# OMEGA Workstation — Purpose & Manifest

Version: 0.2 (Purpose Declaration)
Status: In active development
Spec: See [OMEGA_MAX_SPEC.md](./OMEGA_MAX_SPEC.md) for the full philosophical constitution.

## 1. Core Identity

The OMEGA Workstation is a **Sovereign AI Product Factory** and **Deterministic Tools Kernel**.

It is designed to:

- Build deterministic compilers and tools (SRFC, TSRFC, VRFC, SR-CS, Mech Scientist, etc.).
- Orchestrate AI helpers around deterministic cores (LLMs as wrappers, not oracles).
- Bridge into physical and virtual substrates (physics, USD, XR, streaming).
- Export real artifacts (libraries, APIs, notebooks, dashboards, XR scenes, PI reports).
- Support research, education, product, and civilization-scale planning workflows.

Not a chatbot. Not "just" a code generator.

## 2. Design Principles

These derive from the OMEGA-MAX System Laws:

| ID | Principle | Summary |
|----|-----------|---------|
| P1 | Deterministic Core | Safety-critical logic is rule-based, inspectable, testable |
| P2 | Stochastic Wrapper | LLMs wrap cores for UX; they don't replace them |
| P3 | Non-Sovereignty | No unsupervised autonomous action |
| P4 | Sovereign Operation | Can run locally without mandatory cloud |
| P5 | Plural Surfaces | Same intelligence → CLI, API, XR, reports, curricula |
| P6 | Deep Traceability | Outputs traceable to rules, assumptions, sources |
| P7 | Adoption-First | Real workflows over demos |
| P8 | Technological Adolescence | Extra caution where capability ≫ governance |

## 3. Target Users

- **Students** — guided flows, safe boundaries, deterministic feedback
- **PhD / Postdocs** — quick design screens, experiment planning, novelty/context analysis
- **PIs / Lab Heads** — benchmark packs, lab profiles, override layers, reports
- **Founders / Product Teams** — go-to-market compilers, VRFC/TSRFC/market tooling
- **Systems Thinkers** — scenario engines, incentive maps, temporal planning

## 4. Substrates

The workstation talks to:

| Substrate | Current State |
|-----------|---------------|
| Physics (MuJoCo) | Working |
| USD / Scene Graphs | Stub (JSON) |
| XR / Streaming | Local transport working |
| Compilers (SRFC/TSRFC/VRFC) | Structural stubs |
| Markets / Institutions | Future |

## 5. Temporal Manifold

All work is placed in time:

| Scale | Timeframe | Examples |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| T1 | 0–1 years | Experiments, pilots, local configs |
| T2 | 1–5 years | Products, institutions, norms |
| T3 | 5–30 years | Infrastructure, ecosystems, governance |
| T4 | 30–200+ years | Civilisational arcs, planetary cycles |

## 6. Trajectory Attractors

We track four possible futures:

- **Collapse** — breakdown, war, ecological failure
- **Domination** — authoritarian traps, capture
- **Narrow Optimization** — brittle, fragile to shocks
- **Uplift (η)** — plural, playful, beneficial, continuous

Every design choice should be evaluated against these attractors.

## 7. Non-Goals

- Not an autonomous agent platform
- Not an LLM "persona toy"
- Not a one-off demo script
- Not tied to any single cloud provider

## 8. Present State

- Brain: working planner/generator/validator/assembler pipeline
- Physics substrate: MuJoCo wrapper working
- USD substrate: stubbed JSON representation
- Streaming: local WebSocket/transport layer
- AI provider: Gemini integration (cloud)
- Compilers/Factories/Distribution: structural stubs

This manifest anchors all future architectural decisions.
