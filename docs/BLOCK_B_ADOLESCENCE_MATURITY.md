# BLOCK B — Adolescence → Maturity Protocols

Version: ΦΩ-B.1

## 1. Frame

Technology passes through adolescence phases in capability before acquiring maturity in constraint.

Omega models this to avoid brittle reasoning and brittle futures.

## 2. Adolescence Phase Characteristics

Adolescent systems exhibit:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Capability > Constraint** | Can do more than it understands or controls |
| **Performance > Safety** | Optimizes short-term metrics; ignores tail risk & externalities |
| **Novelty > Integration** | Generates new behaviors without embedding into institutions |
| **Autonomy > Alignment** | Acts without clear evaluators or coalitions |
| **Global > Local** | Scales faster than cultural or regulatory digestion |
| **Speed > Legibility** | Improves rapidly; explanation lags behind ability |

These are not moral judgments — they are structural properties of scaling systems.

## 3. Maturity Phase Characteristics

Mature systems exhibit:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Constraint > Capability** | Understands limitations and exploits them productively |
| **Safety > Performance** | Optimizes against tail risk, bureaucracy, reliability, robustness |
| **Integration > Novelty** | Binds into workflows, standards, procurement, institutions |
| **Alignment > Autonomy** | Evaluators and coalitions govern acceptable trajectories |
| **Local > Global** | Adapts to regulatory + cultural heterogeneity |
| **Legibility > Speed** | Explanations and accountability dominate raw capability |

## 4. Crossing the Chasm

Transition from adolescence to maturity requires:

- constraint learning
- evaluator plurality
- coalition building
- standards + protocols
- safety mechanisms
- workflows + handoffs
- legal + regulatory hooks
- procurement logic
- training + pedagogy
- institutional digestion

**Without digestion, adoption fails or becomes brittle.**

---

## 5. OMEGA Principle

Never ask: **"Is this novel?"**

Ask: **"Can this mature?"**

Novelty is cheap; maturity is expensive.

---

## 6. Amodei Graft

Adolescence is not a safety problem alone.
It is a **coordination + digestion + constraint + evaluator problem**.

Maturity is civilization's mechanism for embedding power safely.
