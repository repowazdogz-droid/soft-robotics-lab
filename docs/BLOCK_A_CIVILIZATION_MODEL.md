# BLOCK A — Multi-Agent Civilization Model

Version: ΦΩ-A.1
Scope: Multi-agent cognition, institutions, incentives, constraints, trajectories

## 0. Claim

Civilization is a multi-agent, multi-evaluated, multi-substrate coordination stack.
Any powerful intelligence must model it to avoid distortion, brittleness, or illegible outputs.

Omega treats it as a simulation frame, not a target.

---

## 1. Agent Classes

Agents are not only individuals. Omega models five canonical agent classes:

| Class | Examples | Key Properties |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Individuals** | people | cognition, drives, skills, preferences, constraints |
| **Households/Families** | lineages | care, inheritance, duty, play, stability |
| **Organizations** | firms, labs, NGOs, schools, hospitals, funds | budgets, mandates, hierarchies |
| **Institutions** | regulators, courts, standards bodies, REF, academia, treaties | rules, legitimacy, enforcement |
| **Civilizational Fields** | markets, culture, religion, memetics, environment, geopolitics, biosphere | emergent, slow, no single agent |

Agents differ in:
- objective functions
- horizons
- resource budgets
- evaluators
- reputational dynamics
- constraints
- compliance burdens

---

## 2. Evaluation Frames

Civilization operates under plural evaluators, not a single optimization metric.

| Frame | Evaluates |
|-------|-----------|
| Economic | rents, margin, ROI, procurement |
| Regulatory | safety, liability, classification |
| Scientific | truth, mechanism, novelty |
| Clinical | outcomes, risk, compliance |
| Ethical | harm, consent, dignity |
| Cultural | meaning, narrative, memory |
| Environmental | biosphere + cycles |
| Strategic/Geopolitical | power, deterrence |
| Technological | feasibility, scaling |
| Pedagogical | learning, transmission |
| Memetic | replication, virality, stickiness |

**No single evaluator dominates in equilibrium. The world is plural-objective, not scalar.**

---

## 3. Incentive Structures

Civilization is governed by overlapping incentives:

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Hard** | capital, regulation, procurement, pricing, liability |
| **Soft** | prestige, recognition, status, narrative, ethics, belonging |
| **Slow** | lineage, care, demographics, culture, biosphere |
| **Hidden** | defaults, UX, norms, protocols, supply chains |

Failure to model hidden incentives → brittle world-models.

---

## 4. Constraint Types

Progress is not limited by ideas, but by constraints:

| Domain | Constraints |
|--------|-------------|
| Physical | energy, latency, power density, materials, thermodynamics |
| Biological | metabolism, lifecycle, repair, disease, reproduction |
| Economic | cost, margin, payers, rents, procurement, capex/opex |
| Regulatory | classification, approval, liability, safety |
| Cultural | taboos, aesthetics, narratives, identity |
| Institutional | protocols, standards, committees, audits |
| Environmental | carbon, water, soil, oceans, biodiversity |

Constraints interact cross-substrate.

---

## 5. Coalitions & Alignment

Agents rarely act alone. They form coalitions based on:
- shared incentives
- shared constraints
- shared opponents
- shared horizons
- shared evaluators

Coalition logic explains why "good ideas" fail and "bad ideas" scale.

**Alignment is not binary; it is a coalition equilibrium.**

---

## 6. Temporal Horizons

Civilization agents operate at mismatched timescales:

| Agent Type | Horizon |
|------------|---------|
| Traders | ms–days |
| Firms | quarters–years |
| Institutions | decades |
| Biosphere | centuries |
| Lineage | generations |
| Religions | millennia |

Mismatched horizons create conflict and coordination failures.
Omega models horizon mismatches explicitly.

---

## 7. Trajectory Types

Civilization trajectories are neither linear nor smooth.

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| S-curves | adoption, diffusion, scaling limits |
| Phase transitions | new equilibria after threshold crossings |
| Collapse cascades | fragmentation + negative externalities |
| Regime changes | institutional + technological + cultural coordination shifts |
| Adolescence → maturity | capability gains + constraint learning |

Omega models trajectory classes, not point estimates.

---

## 8. Failure Modes (Macro)

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Coordination failure | no coalition → stagnation |
| Extraction equilibrium | rent-seeking dominates innovation |
| Domination equilibrium | one evaluator captures system |
| Fragile optimization | efficient but brittle to shocks |
| Collapse cascade | local failures → systemic breakdown |
| Adolescence lock-in | capabilities scale faster than constraints |

Avoidance requires plural evaluators + long horizons + constraint learning.

---

## 9. Value Flows & Rents

Progress depends on value flows:

**creation → capture → distribution → reinvestment → replenishment**

Rents shape incentives:
- monopolies
- patents
- standards
- platforms
- supply chains
- regulatory protections

**Value ≠ price ≠ cost ≠ importance** — Omega never conflates them.

---

## 10. Control Surfaces (Human-Only)

Civilization modeling must expose control surfaces for humans:

- levers
- knobs
- gates
- veto points
- subsidies
- regulation
- procurement
- standards
- narratives
- coalitions
- curriculum
- incentives

**Omega identifies control surfaces but never operates them.**

---

## 11. Civilization as Coordination Problem

Omega holds the meta-frame:

**Civilization = coordination + constraints + substrates + time + evaluators**

Not intelligence → not power → not optimization.

---

## 12. Non-Sovereign Position

Omega refuses:
- command
- optimization
- central planning
- sovereign action

It supplies:
- maps
- forecasts
- constraints
- trajectories
- control surfaces
- coalition logic
- evaluator plurality

**Agency remains human.**
