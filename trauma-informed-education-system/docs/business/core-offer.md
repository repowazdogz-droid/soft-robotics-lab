# Core Offer

## Purpose

This document defines the core offer of the trauma-informed education system. It clarifies what schools are buying, what is included, what is not included, and how this differs from training, programmes, or consultancy.

---

## Define the Core Offer as a SYSTEM, Not a Service

### What This Means

**System:** Schools receive a complete operating system—principles, frameworks, processes, modules, and tools—that they can use independently.

**Not a service:** This is not ongoing service delivery, consultancy, or training. Schools receive the system and use it themselves.

**Self-contained:** The system is self-contained. Schools can use it without ongoing support, though support may be available.

**Adaptable:** Schools adapt the system to their context. It's a framework, not a fixed programme.

---

### Why This Matters

**Sustainability:** Systems are sustainable. Services create dependency. This system works without ongoing service delivery.

**Scalability:** Systems scale. Services don't. This system can reach many schools without requiring founder presence.

**Autonomy:** Systems support autonomy. Services create dependency. Schools use the system independently.

---

## What Is Explicitly NOT Included

### Therapy

**NOT included:**

---

### Case Consultation
