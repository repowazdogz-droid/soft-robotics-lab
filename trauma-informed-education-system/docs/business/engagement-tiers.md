# Engagement Tiers

## Purpose

This document defines tiered engagement models designed to protect founder time while supporting schools at different levels. It clarifies what access looks like in each tier, hard caps on live involvement, and when schools should not move up tiers.

---

## Tiered Model Designed to Protect Founder Time

### Why Tiers

**Protect founder time:** Tiers limit founder involvement, protecting founder capacity and sustainability.

**Support different needs:** Different schools have different needs. Tiers provide appropriate support levels.

**Prevent dependency:** Tiers prevent dependency on founder presence or availability.

**Enable scale:** Tiers enable scale without requiring founder presence for all schools.

---

## Tier 1: Asynchronous / License-Based (Default, Scalable)

### What This Tier Includes

**Materials:** Complete system materials (foundations, framework, modules, governance, evidence).

**Modules:** All 8 self-paced modules, accessible asynchronously.

**Implementation guidance:** Cycles, processes, and reflection tools.

**AI tools:** AI guardrails and prompt schemas (if AI is available).

**Independent use:** Schools use the system independently, at their own pace.

---

### What This Tier Does NOT Include

**Does NOT include:**
- Live facilitation or training
- Founder presence or availability
- Ongoing support or check-ins
- Individual consultation or advice
- Case consultation or guidance

**Why:** This tier is designed for independent use. It scales without requiring founder presence.

---

### Access in This Tier

**Access:**
- Digital materials accessible independently
- Self-paced module completion
- Independent implementation
- Optional reflection and learning
- No live support or presence

**Time commitment:** Schools manage their own time. No founder time required.

---

### Hard Caps on Live Involvement

**Founder time:** Zero hours by default. No founder involvement required or expected.

**Support:** No live support included. Schools use materials independently.

**Meetings:** No meetings or check-ins included. Schools implement independently.

**Consultation:** No consultation included. Schools adapt system independently.

---

## Tier 2: Supported Implementation (Limited Touchpoints)

**Total founder time:** Maximum 4–5 hours per cycle (90 days).

---

### What This Tier Does NOT Include

**Does NOT include:**
- Ongoing availability or presence
- Case consultation or advice
- Individual child guidance
- Clinical or therapeutic support
- On-call expert support

**Why:** This tier provides limited support, not ongoing service. It protects founder time.

---

### Access in This Tier

**Sessions:** Maximum 3–4 sessions per cycle (initial, mid-cycle, end-of-cycle, optional boundary support).

**Email support:** Limited to boundary questions. Not ongoing consultation.

**Availability:** No ongoing availability. Support is scheduled and limited.

---

## Tier 3: Premium / Advisory (Small, Capped, High-Boundary)

### What This Tier Includes

**Everything from Tier 1:** All materials, modules, and tools.

**Plus premium support:**
- Initial orientation and planning (2–3 hours)
- Monthly advisory sessions (1 hour per month)
- Boundary consultation (as needed, limited)
- System review and refinement (quarterly, 2 hours)

**Total founder time:** Maximum 8–10 hours per quarter (90 days).

---

### What This Tier Does NOT Include

**Does NOT include:**
- Ongoing availability or presence
- Case consultation or advice
- Individual child guidance
- Clinical or therapeutic support
- On-call expert support
- Unlimited support or availability

**Why:** This tier provides premium support, not unlimited service. It protects founder time with clear boundaries.

---

### Access in This Tier

**Access:**
- Everything from Tier 1
- Premium live support (monthly sessions, quarterly reviews)
- Boundary consultation (as needed, limited)
- No ongoing availability

**Time commitment:** Maximum 8–10 hours founder time per quarter.

---

### Hard Caps on Live Involvement

**Founder time:** Maximum 8–10 hours per quarter.

**Sessions:** Monthly advisory sessions (1 hour) plus quarterly reviews (2 hours).

**Consultation:** Boundary consultation as needed, but limited and scheduled.

**Availability:** No ongoing availability. Support is scheduled and limited.

**Cap on schools:** Maximum number of Tier 3 schools capped to protect founder capacity.

---

## Clear Refusal of "On-Call Expert" Expectations

### What "On-Call Expert" Means

**On-call expert:** Expectation of immediate availability, ongoing consultation, or unlimited support.

**Why this is refused:** On-call expert expectations create dependency, exhaust founder capacity, and prevent scale.

---

### How to Refuse

**Language:** "I'm not available as an on-call expert. I provide scheduled support within tier boundaries. If you need immediate support, please use the system materials or escalate through appropriate professional channels."

**Boundaries:** Clear boundaries about availability, response times, and support limits.

**Redirection:** Redirect to system materials, appropriate professionals, or scheduled support.

---

### What This Means for Schools

**Schools understand:**
- Founder is not available on-call
- Support is scheduled and limited
- System materials are primary resource
- Appropriate professionals handle urgent needs

**Schools do NOT expect:**
- Immediate availability or response
- Ongoing consultation or advice
- Unlimited support or presence
- On-call expert availability

---

## Guidance on When Schools Should NOT Move Up Tiers

### When NOT to Move Up

**Do NOT move up if:**
- You need ongoing availability or presence
- You expect on-call expert support
- You need case consultation or advice
- You want unlimited support
- You're not ready for independent use

**Why:** Moving up tiers doesn't provide these things. Tiers provide limited, scheduled support, not ongoing service.

---

### When to Stay in Lower Tiers

**Stay in Tier 1 if:**
- You can use materials independently
- You don't need live support
- You want to implement at your own pace
- You prefer self-directed learning

**Stay in Tier 2 if:**
- You need limited support but can mostly work independently
- You want scheduled check-ins but not ongoing presence
- You can adapt system to your context with minimal support

---

### Red Flags for Tier Selection

**Red flags:**
- Expectation of ongoing availability
- Need for case consultation or advice
- Expectation of on-call expert support
- Unwillingness to use materials independently
- Dependency on founder presence

**Response:** Clarify boundaries. Redirect to appropriate tier or professional support.

## Tier Boundaries Summary

| Tier | Founder Time | Support Type | Availability | Best For |
|------|-------------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Tier 1 | 0 hours | None (materials only) | None | Independent schools |
| Tier 2 | 4–5 hours/cycle | Limited scheduled | Scheduled only | Schools needing minimal support |
| Tier 3 | 8–10 hours/quarter | Premium scheduled | Scheduled only | Schools needing more support (capped) |

## Founder Time Protection

### Hard Caps

**Tier 1:** Zero hours. No founder involvement.

**Tier 2:** Maximum 4–5 hours per 90-day cycle.

**Tier 3:** Maximum 8–10 hours per quarter. Capped number of schools.

**Why:** Hard caps protect founder capacity and prevent dependency.

---

### What Happens When Caps Are Reached

**Tier 2:** No additional support until next cycle. Schools use materials independently.

**Tier 3:** No additional support until next quarter. Schools use materials independently. New Tier 3 schools waitlisted if cap reached.

**Why:** Caps protect founder capacity. Schools can always use Tier 1 materials independently.

---

## System Survival Without Founder

### All Tiers Work Without Founder

**Tier 1:** Works completely independently. No founder required.

**Tier 2:** Materials work independently. Scheduled support can be paused or cancelled.

**Tier 3:** Materials work independently. Scheduled support can be paused or cancelled.

**Why:** System is designed to work without founder presence. Tiers add support, but don't create dependency.

---

### What Happens If Founder Is Absent

**Schools can:**
- Continue using materials independently
- Complete modules at their own pace
- Implement system without support
- Adapt system to their context
- Evolve system based on learning

**No dependency:** System works without founder. Support is optional, not required.
