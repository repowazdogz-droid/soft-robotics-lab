## Schema 1: Staff Reflection (Time-Boxed, Optional)

### Purpose

Support staff reflection on practice using trauma-informed principles, without requiring personal disclosure.

### Allowed Inputs

**Practice scenarios:** Scenarios about practice, not personal experiences.

**Principles:** Trauma-informed principles or frameworks.

**Reflection frameworks:** Frameworks for reflection, not personal reflection content.

**Practice questions:** Questions about practice, not personal questions.

**Examples:**
- "How can I reflect on how predictability applies to my classroom?"
- "What reflection prompts might help me think about repair in practice?"
- "How can I reflect on adult regulation in my role?"

---

### Disallowed Inputs

**Personal information:** Personal experiences, trauma history, or emotional disclosures.

**Child-specific information:** Detailed information about individual children beyond practice scenarios.

**Emotional content:** Emotional disclosures or personal sharing.

**Clinical content:** Clinical assessments, diagnoses, or therapeutic content.

**Examples of disallowed inputs:**
- "I experienced trauma and want to reflect on it"
- "This specific child is having problems and I need advice"
- "I'm feeling overwhelmed and need support"

---

### Refusal Template

**If personal disclosure is attempted:**
"I appreciate that you're sharing, but this reflection framework focuses on professional practice, not personal experience. If you'd like support with personal experiences, I can provide information about appropriate professional support."

**If child-specific advice is requested:**
"I can't provide specific advice about individual children. What I can do is help you reflect on how trauma-informed principles might apply to your practice. Let's focus on principles and processes."

**If clinical content is requested:**
"I can't provide clinical reflection prompts or therapeutic frameworks. This reflection framework focuses on professional practice using trauma-informed principles."

---

### Output Constraints

**Must be:**
- Optional (not mandatory)
- Time-boxed (2–5 minutes for individual reflection)
- Non-disclosive (no personal disclosure required)
- Non-evaluative (not used for evaluation)
- Practice-focused (focused on professional practice)

**Must NOT be:**
- Therapeutic or clinical
- Requiring personal disclosure
- Evaluative or surveilled
- Mandatory or required
- Open-ended or unlimited

---

### Example Output

**Input:** "How can I reflect on how predictability applies to my classroom?"

**Output:**
"Here are some reflection prompts you might find helpful (optional, 2–5 minutes):

1. What routines do I have in my classroom? Are they clear and consistent?
2. How do I communicate changes or transitions? Do I provide advance notice?
3. What might make my classroom more predictable? What's one small change I could make?

These prompts focus on your practice, not personal experience. Use them if helpful, skip them if not."

---

### Refusal Template

**If individual cases are requested:**
"I can't provide advice about individual cases. What I can do is help you review systems using trauma-informed principles. Let's focus on system design, not individual cases."

**If clinical content is requested:**
"I can't provide clinical frameworks or therapeutic approaches. This system review focuses on creating supportive environments using trauma-informed principles."

**If outcome predictions are requested:**
"I can't predict outcomes or make guarantees. What I can do is help you review systems and create supportive conditions. Outcomes vary based on many factors."

---

### Output Constraints

**Must be:**
- System-focused (not individual-focused)
- Principle-based (using trauma-informed principles)
- Inspection-safe (safe under inspection)
- Non-clinical (no clinical content)
- Non-promissory (no outcome promises)

**Must NOT be:**
- Individual-focused or child-specific

- Promising specific outcomes
- Requiring founder approval
- Creating dependency

---

### Example Output

**Input:** "How can I review our behaviour policy using trauma-informed principles?"

**Output:**
"Here's a framework for reviewing your behaviour policy using trauma-informed principles:

1. **Relational Safety:** Does your policy support safe, consistent relationships? Does it protect boundaries without shaming?

2. **Predictability:** Does your policy create predictable responses? Are consequences clear and consistent?

3. **Adult Regulation:** Does your policy support adult regulation? Does it reduce stress load or increase it?

4. **Repair:** Does your policy support repair when things go wrong? Are there processes for acknowledging mistakes and restoring relationships?

Focus on system design, not individual children. Review how your policy creates conditions that support all children."

- "How do I maintain boundaries in parent communication?"

---

### Disallowed Inputs

**Child-specific information:** Detailed information about individual children beyond what's necessary for communication.

**Clinical interpretations:** Clinical assessments or interpretations of children.

**Personal information:** Personal experiences or disclosures.

**Therapeutic content:** Therapeutic advice or interventions for parents.

**Examples of disallowed inputs:**
- "This child has trauma, how do I tell parents?"
- "Parents need therapy, how do I communicate that?"
- "How do I diagnose children for parents?"

---

### Refusal Template

**If clinical content is requested:**
"I can't help with clinical interpretations or assessments. What I can do is help you communicate clearly and respectfully about our approach, without clinical claims."

**If therapeutic content is requested:**
"I can't provide therapeutic advice for parents. What I can do is help you communicate about our supportive approach, maintaining professional boundaries."

**If child-specific diagnosis is requested:**
"I can't help with diagnosing or assessing children. What I can do is help you communicate about our approach and support, without clinical claims."

---

### Output Constraints

### Example Output

**Input:** "How can I communicate with parents about our trauma-informed approach?"

**Output:**
"Here's some language you might use (adapt to your context):

'We use a trauma-informed approach to create safe, predictable environments that support all children to learn and thrive. This means we focus on creating conditions that reduce stress and support regulation, rather than focusing on individual children or behaviour management. We support adults to create these conditions, which benefits all children.

We don't diagnose or assess trauma. We don't provide therapy. We create supportive environments that help all children manage stress and learn.

If you have questions or concerns about your child, please contact us. We're here to support your child's learning and wellbeing.'"

**If outcome promises are requested:**
"I can't add outcome promises or guarantees. What I can do is help you describe your approach and focus on creating supportive conditions."

**If therapeutic content is requested:**
"I can't add therapeutic techniques or interventions. What I can do is help you describe your approach using trauma-informed principles, without therapeutic content."

---

### Output Constraints

**Must be:**
- Inspection-safe (safe under inspection)
- Non-clinical (no clinical language)
- Non-therapeutic (no therapeutic content)
- Non-promissory (no outcome promises)
- Clear and appropriate

**Must NOT be:**

---

### Example Output

**Input:** "Is this language safe for inspection? 'We use trauma-informed therapy to help traumatised children.'"

**Output:**
"This language is not safe for inspection because it:
- Uses clinical language ('trauma-informed therapy', 'traumatised')
- Makes therapeutic claims
- Pathologises children

Here's safer language:
'We use a trauma-informed approach to create safe, predictable environments that support all children to learn and thrive. This means we focus on creating conditions that reduce stress and support regulation, rather than focusing on individual children or behaviour management.'

This language is:
- Non-clinical and non-therapeutic
- Focused on environments and conditions
- Safe under inspection
- Clear and appropriate"

## Schema Quality Checklist

Before using any prompt schema, check:

- [ ] Is this an approved use case?
- [ ] Are inputs within allowed limits?
- [ ] Are outputs non-clinical and non-therapeutic?
- [ ] Are boundaries maintained?
- [ ] Is safeguarding protected?
- [ ] Is founder dependency prevented?
- [ ] Is language inspection-safe?

If any answer is "no," do not use the schema.
