# Refusal Boundaries

## Purpose

This document defines what requests are refused, how refusals are communicated, and what can be offered instead. It provides scripts for common refusal scenarios and ensures the system survives refusal without founder dependency.

---

## What Requests Are Refused (Examples)

### Clinical Requests

**Refused:**
- "Can you diagnose this child?"
- "Can you assess if trauma is present?"
- "Can you tell us what's wrong with this child?"
- "Can you provide clinical assessment?"

**Why:** Clinical assessment requires professional training and appropriate assessment. This system does not provide clinical expertise.

---

### Therapeutic Requests

**Refused:**
- "Can you provide therapy for this child?"
- "Can you help us with therapeutic interventions?"
- "Can you give us therapy techniques?"
- "Can you treat this child?"

**Why:** Therapy requires professional training and appropriate boundaries. This system does not provide therapy.

---

### Individual Child Advice

**Refused:**
- "Can you advise about this specific child?"
- "What should we do about this child?"
- "How do we help this child?"
- "Can you tell us what this child needs?"

**Why:** Advice about individual children requires professional assessment and context. This system focuses on systems and environments, not individual children.

---

### Outcome Predictions

**Refused:**
- "Will this work?"
- "What will happen if we do this?"
- "Can you predict outcomes?"
- "Will this help the child?"

**Why:** Outcomes vary based on many factors. This system cannot predict outcomes or make guarantees.

---

### Safeguarding Advice

**Refused:**
- "What should we do about this safeguarding concern?"
- "Can you help us with this safeguarding situation?"
- "How do we handle this safeguarding issue?"

**Why:** Safeguarding requires professional procedures and appropriate response. This system does not provide safeguarding advice.

---

## How Refusals Are Communicated (Calm, Respectful, Non-Defensive)

### Refusal Principles

**Calm:** Refusals are communicated calmly, without defensiveness or judgment.

**Respectful:** Refusals respect the person asking, even when refusing the request.

**Non-defensive:** Refusals are not defensive or apologetic. They are clear and direct.

**Helpful:** Refusals offer alternatives when possible, redirecting to what can be offered.

---

### Refusal Language

**Structure:**
1. Acknowledge the request
2. Clearly refuse what cannot be provided
3. Explain why (briefly)
4. Offer alternatives or redirection

**Tone:** Calm, respectful, clear, helpful.

---

## Scripts for Common Refusal Scenarios

### Script 1: "Can You Advise About This Child?"

**Request:** "Can you advise about this specific child?"

**Refusal:** "I can't provide specific advice about individual children without proper assessment and context. What I can do is help you think through trauma-informed principles and processes that might apply. Let's consider: What need might be communicated? How can you create safety and predictability? What support might be needed? And remember to follow your safeguarding procedures."

**Redirection:** Redirect to principles and processes. Remind about safeguarding. Focus on system support, not individual advice.

---

### Script 2: "Can You Help Us Manage This Behaviour?"

**Request:** "Can you help us manage this child's behaviour?"

**Refusal:** "I can't provide behaviour management advice for individual children. What I can do is help you think about creating predictable, supportive environments that reduce stress and support regulation. Let's consider: How can you create predictability? How can you support regulation? How can you respond to need, not just behaviour? And remember to follow your safeguarding procedures."

**Redirection:** Redirect to creating environments and supporting regulation. Focus on systems, not behaviour management.

---

### Script 3: "Can You Tell Us If Trauma Is Present?"

**Request:** "Can you tell us if trauma is present in this child?"

**Refusal:** "I can't assess or diagnose trauma. That requires professional training and appropriate assessment. What I can do is help you understand how stress and adversity can affect children, and how to create supportive environments that reduce harm and increase safety. If you have concerns about a child, I'd encourage you to follow your school's safeguarding procedures and consult with appropriate professionals."

**Redirection:** Redirect to creating supportive environments. Remind about safeguarding and professional support.

---

### Script 4: "Can You Provide Therapy?"

**Request:** "Can you provide therapy for this child?"

**Refusal:** "I can't provide therapy or therapeutic interventions. That requires professional training and appropriate boundaries. If therapy is needed, I can provide information about appropriate professional support. What I can do is help you create supportive environments that reduce stress and support regulation."

**Redirection:** Redirect to appropriate professional support. Focus on creating supportive environments.

---

### Script 5: "Will This Work?"

**Request:** "Will this approach work?"

**Refusal:** "I can't predict outcomes or make guarantees. Outcomes vary based on many factors. What I can do is help you think about creating supportive conditions and learning from experience. We focus on creating conditions that support learning and regulation, not on promising specific outcomes."

**Redirection:** Focus on creating conditions and learning, not predicting outcomes.

---

## Redirection Pathways (What *Can* Be Offered Instead)

### Instead of Individual Child Advice

**Offer:**
- Principles and frameworks that might apply
- Processes for responding to need
- System support and environmental design
- Reflection prompts focused on practice
- Reminders about safeguarding procedures

**Example:** "I can't provide specific advice about this child, but I can help you think through trauma-informed principles and processes that might apply. Let's consider the principles and processes, and remember to follow your safeguarding procedures."

---

### Instead of Behaviour Management

**Offer:**
- Creating predictable, supportive environments
- Supporting regulation through adult regulation
- Responding to need, not just behaviour
- System design that reduces stress
- Processes for repair and learning

**Example:** "I can't provide behaviour management advice, but I can help you think about creating environments that reduce stress and support regulation. Let's focus on systems and environments, not behaviour management."

---

### Instead of Clinical Assessment

**Offer:**
- Understanding how stress affects learning and regulation
- Creating supportive environments
- Supporting appropriate professional referral
- Reminders about safeguarding procedures
- System support and design

## Founder-Protection Clause (System Survives Refusal)

### System Independence

**Requirement:** The system must survive refusal without requiring founder presence or approval.

**What this means:**

- Refusal scripts are provided
- Redirection pathways are clear
- System continues to function after refusal

**How this is ensured:**
- Clear refusal scripts and language
- Redirection pathways defined
- Boundaries built into all materials
- No founder approval required for refusals

---

### Refusal Without Dependency

**Requirement:** Refusals must not create dependency on the founder or system creator.

**What this means:**
- Refusals are clear and self-contained
- Redirection is to appropriate professionals, not founder
- System continues to function independently
- No founder presence required for refusals

**How this is ensured:**
- Refusal scripts are provided
- Redirection is to appropriate professionals
- System materials support independent operation
- No founder dependency created

---

### System Resilience

**Requirement:** The system must be resilient to refusal scenarios.

**What this means:**
- System continues to function when requests are refused
- Refusals don't break the system
- Redirection maintains system function
- Boundaries protect system integrity

**How this is ensured:**
- Clear boundaries and refusals
- Redirection pathways maintain function
- System materials support resilience
- No dependency on specific responses

## Refusal Quality Checklist

Before refusing a request, check:

- [ ] Is the refusal clear and respectful?
- [ ] Is the reason explained briefly?
- [ ] Are alternatives or redirection offered?
- [ ] Are boundaries maintained?
- [ ] Is safeguarding protected?
