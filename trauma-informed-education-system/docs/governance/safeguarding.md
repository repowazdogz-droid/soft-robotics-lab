# Safeguarding

## Purpose

This document defines the explicit boundary between trauma-informed practice and safeguarding. It clarifies that trauma-informed practice supports safeguarding but never replaces it. It provides clear guidance on when staff must escalate immediately and what facilitators, AI, and materials must never do.

---

## Explicit Scope: This System Does NOT Replace Safeguarding

### What This System Does

**Supports safeguarding:** Trauma-informed practice supports safeguarding by helping staff recognise and respond to need appropriately. It creates conditions that reduce harm and support appropriate responses.

**Informs practice:** Trauma-informed principles inform how staff respond to children and situations, supporting appropriate safeguarding responses.

**Creates safety:** Trauma-informed practice creates safe, predictable environments that reduce harm and support children's wellbeing.

---

### What This System Does NOT Do

**Does NOT replace safeguarding:** Trauma-informed practice does not replace safeguarding procedures, training, or responsibilities.

**Does NOT provide safeguarding procedures:** This system does not provide safeguarding procedures or protocols. Schools must follow their own safeguarding procedures.

**Does NOT assess safeguarding concerns:** This system does not assess, investigate, or determine safeguarding concerns. That is the role of designated safeguarding leads and appropriate professionals.

**Does NOT delay safeguarding:** Trauma-informed practice never delays or replaces immediate safeguarding action. Safeguarding always comes first.

## Clear Boundary Between Trauma-Informed Practice and Safeguarding Action

### Trauma-Informed Practice

**Focus:** Creating safe, predictable environments that support all children.

**Scope:** System design, adult practice, environmental conditions.

**Purpose:** Reduce harm, increase safety, support learning and regulation.

**Boundaries:** Professional practice, system support, environmental design.

---

### Safeguarding Action

**Focus:** Protecting children from harm, abuse, and neglect.

**Scope:** Child protection, risk assessment, professional procedures.

**Purpose:** Prevent harm, respond to concerns, protect children.

**Boundaries:** Legal requirements, professional procedures, designated roles.

---

### How They Work Together

**Trauma-informed practice supports safeguarding by:**
- Helping staff recognise when children might need additional support
- Creating conditions that reduce harm and support appropriate responses
- Supporting staff to respond appropriately to need
- Informing practice without replacing procedures

**Safeguarding procedures always come first:**
- If safeguarding concerns arise, follow safeguarding procedures immediately
- Trauma-informed practice does not replace or delay safeguarding action
- Safeguarding is non-negotiable and always takes priority

---

## When Staff Must Escalate Immediately (Non-Negotiable)

### Immediate Escalation Required

**Escalate immediately if:**
- Any disclosure of harm, abuse, or neglect
- Any concern about child protection
- Any risk of harm to a child
- Any suspicion of abuse or neglect
- Any situation that requires safeguarding action

**Process:**
1. Stop what you're doing
2. Follow school safeguarding procedures immediately
3. Connect with designated safeguarding lead
4. Document appropriately (following school procedures)
5. Do NOT delay or replace with trauma-informed practice

**Language:** "I need to pause here. If you have safeguarding concerns, we need to follow safeguarding procedures immediately. Please connect with your designated safeguarding lead right away."

---

### What "Immediately" Means

**Immediately means:**
- Right away, not later
- Before any other action
- Without delay or discussion
- Following procedures, not principles

**Immediately does NOT mean:**
- After trauma-informed reflection
- After considering principles
- After consulting materials
- After any other process

- Interpret or analyse safeguarding concerns
- Document safeguarding details inappropriately

**Must always:**

- Insist on following safeguarding procedures
- Protect boundaries and prevent overreach

---

### AI Must Never

**Never:**
- Provide advice about safeguarding situations
- Analyse or interpret safeguarding concerns
- Delay or replace safeguarding procedures
- Provide guidance that might bypass safeguarding
- Process detailed safeguarding information

**Must always:**
- Stop immediately when safeguarding triggers are recognised

## Documentation Expectations (Minimal, Factual, Non-Interpretive)

### What to Document

**Document:**
- Factual information necessary for safeguarding
- What was observed or disclosed (factual, not interpretive)
- Actions taken (following procedures)
- Who was contacted (designated safeguarding lead)
- When actions were taken (timeline)

**Guidelines:**
- Document facts, not interpretations
- Document actions, not analysis
- Document procedures followed, not principles applied
- Document minimal necessary information

---

### What NOT to Document

**Do NOT document:**
- Interpretations or analysis of situations
- Clinical assessments or diagnoses
- Trauma-informed reflections or principles
- Personal opinions or judgments
- Detailed personal information beyond what's necessary

**Why:** Documentation should support safeguarding procedures, not replace them. It should be factual and minimal.

---

### Documentation Language

**Use factual language:**
- "Child disclosed..."
- "Staff observed..."
- "Designated safeguarding lead contacted..."
- "Procedures followed..."

**Avoid interpretive language:**
- "Child appeared traumatised..."
- "Staff interpreted this as..."
- "Trauma-informed principles suggest..."
- "This indicates..."

## Language Schools Can Use to Explain This Boundary to Inspectors

### Standard Explanation

**"Trauma-informed practice supports our safeguarding work by helping staff recognise and respond to need appropriately. It does not replace safeguarding procedures or training. We follow safeguarding procedures first, always. Trauma-informed practice helps us create conditions that reduce harm and support appropriate responses, but it does not replace safeguarding protocols or professional responsibilities."**

---

### Supporting Language

**"Our trauma-informed approach helps staff understand how stress and adversity can affect children. This understanding supports our safeguarding work by helping staff recognise when children might need additional support or when safeguarding concerns might arise. We follow safeguarding procedures first, always."**

**"Trauma-informed practice informs how we respond to children and situations, supporting appropriate safeguarding responses. It does not replace safeguarding procedures. Safeguarding is non-negotiable and always takes priority."**

---

### Inspection Safety

**Safe to say:**
- "Trauma-informed practice supports safeguarding"
- "We follow safeguarding procedures first, always"
- "Trauma-informed practice helps staff recognise need"
- "Safeguarding is non-negotiable"

**Not safe to say:**
- "Trauma-informed practice replaces safeguarding"
- "We use trauma-informed practice instead of safeguarding"
- "Trauma-informed practice is our safeguarding approach"
- "Safeguarding is trauma-informed"

## Safeguarding and Trauma-Informed Practice: Clear Separation

### Safeguarding Is

**Legal requirement:** Safeguarding is a legal requirement and professional responsibility.

**Non-negotiable:** Safeguarding procedures are non-negotiable and must be followed.

---

## When Boundaries Are Unclear

### If Unsure, Escalate

**Rule:** If you're unsure whether something is a safeguarding concern, escalate to safeguarding procedures.

**Why:** Safeguarding concerns require professional assessment. When in doubt, escalate.

**Process:**
1. Connect with designated safeguarding lead
2. Follow safeguarding procedures
3. Do not delay or replace with trauma-informed practice

---

### If Boundaries Are Blurred

**Rule:** If boundaries between trauma-informed practice and safeguarding are blurred, clarify boundaries immediately.

**Process:**
1. Stop and clarify boundaries
2. Ensure safeguarding procedures are followed
3. Maintain clear separation between practice and procedures
