# Ethics

## Purpose

This document defines the ethical commitments that govern the trauma-informed education system. It addresses power dynamics, consent, participation, and what happens when ethical tensions arise. It explicitly states non-claims and non-promises.

## Ethical Commitments

### Do No Harm

**Commitment:** This system must not create harm, increase risk, or cause damage.

**What this means:**
- We do not provide therapy, diagnosis, or clinical interventions
- We do not pathologise children or adults
- We do not create dependency or vulnerability
- We do not override safeguarding or professional boundaries

**How we ensure this:**
- Clear boundaries and refusals
- Safeguarding always comes first
- Professional boundaries maintained
- No therapeutic overreach

---

### Do Not Overreach

**Commitment:** This system stays within its scope and does not overreach into areas requiring different expertise.

**What this means:**
- We do not provide clinical expertise or assessment
- We do not provide therapeutic interventions
- We do not replace safeguarding or professional procedures
- We do not diagnose or assess trauma

**How we ensure this:**
- Clear scope boundaries
- Explicit refusals
- Redirection to appropriate professionals
- No clinical or therapeutic content

---

### Do Not Diagnose

**Commitment:** This system does not diagnose, assess, or label children, adults, or situations.

**What this means:**
- We do not diagnose trauma or stress
- We do not assess children or adults
- We do not label or pathologise
- We do not make clinical claims

**How we ensure this:**
- No diagnostic language
- No assessment tools
- No clinical claims
- Descriptive language only

## Power-Awareness (Adult Authority, Child Vulnerability)

### Adult Authority

**Recognition:** Adults have authority over children in school contexts. This power dynamic must be recognised and managed ethically.

**What this means:**
- Adults have responsibility to protect and support children
- Adults must not abuse authority or power
- Adults must maintain appropriate boundaries
- Adults must recognise their impact on children

**How we ensure this:**
- Clear professional boundaries
- Support for adult regulation
- Recognition of power dynamics
- Protection of children's rights

---

### Child Vulnerability

**Recognition:** Children are vulnerable in school contexts. This vulnerability must be recognised and protected.

**What this means:**
- Children depend on adults for safety and support
- Children's rights must be protected
- Children must not be exploited or harmed
- Children must have appropriate support

**How we ensure this:**
- Safeguarding always comes first
- Clear boundaries protect children
- No exploitation or harm
- Appropriate support provided

---

### Power Dynamics

**Recognition:** Power dynamics exist in all relationships. These must be recognised and managed ethically.

**What this means:**
- Adults have power over children
- Leaders have power over staff
- Systems have power over individuals
- Power must be used ethically

**How we ensure this:**
- Recognition of power dynamics
- Ethical use of power
- Protection of vulnerable parties
- Clear boundaries and accountability

---

## Consent & Participation Rules

### Staff Consent

**Rule:** Staff participation in trauma-informed practice is voluntary and consensual.

**What this means:**
- Staff choose whether to participate
- Staff can stop or withdraw at any time
- Staff are not pressured or coerced
- Staff maintain autonomy and choice

**How we ensure this:**
- Optional participation
- No mandatory requirements
- Clear boundaries and refusals
- Respect for autonomy

---

### Parent Consent

**Rule:** Parent participation is voluntary and consensual. Schools do not require parent participation.

**What this means:**
- Parents choose whether to participate
- Parents can stop or withdraw at any time
- Parents are not pressured or coerced
- Parents maintain autonomy and choice

**How we ensure this:**
- Optional participation
- No mandatory requirements
- Clear boundaries and refusals
- Respect for autonomy

---

### Child Participation

**Rule:** This system does not work directly with children. Children do not participate in trauma-informed practice modules or materials.

**What this means:**
- Children are not asked to participate
- Children are not assessed or evaluated
- Children are not required to engage
- Children benefit indirectly through adult support

**How we ensure this:**
- No child-facing materials
- No child participation required
- No child assessment or evaluation
- Indirect benefit through adult support

---

## What Happens When Ethical Tension Arises

### Recognising Ethical Tension

**Signs of ethical tension:**
- Boundaries being crossed or blurred
- Power being misused
- Harm being created or increased
- Overreach occurring
- Safeguarding being bypassed

**Response:** Stop immediately. Address ethical tension before continuing.

---

### Addressing Ethical Tension

**Process:**
1. Recognise and acknowledge ethical tension
2. Stop current activity
3. Clarify boundaries and principles
4. Address tension appropriately
5. Resume only when tension is resolved

**Support:** Seek appropriate support or supervision when ethical tension arises.

---

### Escalation When Needed

**Escalate if:**
- Ethical tension cannot be resolved
- Harm is being created or increased
- Boundaries are being violated
- Safeguarding is being bypassed
- Power is being misused

**Process:** Escalate to appropriate supervision, leadership, or professional support.

## Explicit Non-Claims and Non-Promises

### What We Do NOT Claim

**We do NOT claim:**
- That trauma-informed practice diagnoses or assesses trauma
- That trauma-informed practice provides therapy or therapeutic interventions
- That trauma-informed practice fixes or treats children
- That trauma-informed practice guarantees specific outcomes
- That trauma-informed practice works for all children in all situations
- That trauma-informed practice replaces safeguarding or professional procedures

**Why:** These claims would be inaccurate, unsafe, or inappropriate. Being explicit about non-claims protects everyone.

---

### What We Do NOT Promise

**We do NOT promise:**
- Specific outcomes or results
- That children will improve or change
- That behaviour will improve
- That stress will reduce
- That learning will increase
- That problems will be solved

**Why:** Outcomes vary based on many factors. Promising specific outcomes creates false expectations and cannot be guaranteed.

---

### What We DO Claim

**We DO claim:**
- That trauma-informed practice creates supportive environments
- That trauma-informed practice supports adult regulation
- That trauma-informed practice increases predictability
- That trauma-informed practice supports repair and learning
- That trauma-informed practice informs practice and system design

**Why:** These claims are accurate, safe, and appropriate. They describe what the system does without overclaiming.

## Ethical Decision-Making Framework

### When Facing Ethical Decisions

**Questions to consider:**
- Does this do no harm?
- Does this stay within scope?
- Does this maintain boundaries?
- Does this protect vulnerable parties?
- Does this respect autonomy and consent?

**If any answer is "no," do not proceed. Address ethical concerns first.**

---

### Ethical Red Flags

**Stop if:**
- Harm is being created or increased
- Boundaries are being crossed
- Power is being misused
- Overreach is occurring
- Safeguarding is being bypassed
- Consent is not respected

**Response:** Stop immediately. Address red flags before continuing.
