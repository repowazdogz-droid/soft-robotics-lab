# Claims Discipline

## Purpose

This document defines explicit rules for what can and cannot be claimed about the trauma-informed education system. It provides approved phrasing, inspection-safe wording, and guidance for staff, leaders, marketing, and AI. It protects against misuse and overclaiming.

---

## Explicit Rules for What Can and Cannot Be Claimed

### No Outcome Guarantees

**Rule:** Never claim or promise specific outcomes.

**Prohibited language:**
- "This will improve behaviour"
- "This will reduce stress"
- "This will increase learning"
- "This will help children"
- "This guarantees results"

**Why:** Outcomes vary based on many factors. Promising specific outcomes creates false expectations and cannot be guaranteed.

---

### No Causal Language

**Rule:** Never use causal language that implies one thing leads to another.

**Prohibited language:**
- "This leads to improved outcomes"
- "This results in better behaviour"
- "This causes reduced stress"
- "This produces better learning"
- "This creates positive change"

**Why:** Causal claims require evidence of causation. This system does not have evidence of causation. Correlation and causation are different.

---

### No Predictive Claims

**Rule:** Never predict what will happen.

**Prohibited language:**
- "This will work"
- "This will help"
- "This will improve"
- "This will change"
- "This will produce"

**Why:** Predictions create false expectations. Outcomes vary based on many factors. We cannot predict what will happen.

---

### No Comparative Claims

**Rule:** Never claim this system is better than other approaches.

**Prohibited language:**
- "This is better than..."
- "This works better than..."
- "This is more effective than..."
- "This produces better outcomes than..."

**Why:** Comparative claims require evidence of comparison. This system does not have comparative evidence.

---

### No Efficacy Claims

**Rule:** Never claim this system is effective or proven.

**Prohibited language:**
- "This system is effective"
- "This system is proven"
- "This system works"
- "This system is validated"
- "This system is evidence-based"

**Why:** Efficacy claims require evidence of effectiveness. This system is evidence-informed, not evidence-based.

---

## Approved Phrasing Examples (Safe Alternatives)

### Instead of Outcome Guarantees

**Instead of:** "This will improve behaviour"

**Use:** "This system focuses on creating supportive environments that may support learning and regulation. Outcomes vary based on many factors."

---

### Instead of Causal Language

**Instead of:** "This leads to improved outcomes"

**Use:** "This system creates conditions that support learning and regulation. We focus on creating conditions, not promising outcomes."

---

### Instead of Predictive Claims

**Instead of:** "This will work"

**Use:** "This system provides frameworks and principles that schools adapt to their context. We focus on creating conditions and learning from experience."

---

### Instead of Comparative Claims

**Instead of:** "This is better than other approaches"

**Use:** "This system provides one approach to creating supportive environments. Schools choose approaches that fit their context and needs."

---

### Instead of Efficacy Claims

**Instead of:** "This system is effective"

**Use:** "This system is evidence-informed, drawing on principles from trauma-informed education research. It is a framework that schools adapt to their context."

---

## Inspection-Safe Wording Guidance

### What Inspectors Want to Hear

**Safe language:**
- "We use a trauma-informed approach to create supportive environments"
- "This system helps us understand how stress affects learning and regulation"
- "We focus on creating conditions that support all children"
- "This system informs our practice and system design"
- "We adapt the system to our context and needs"

**Why:** This language is clear, professional, and appropriate. It describes what you do without overclaiming.

---

### What Inspectors Do NOT Want to Hear

**Unsafe language:**
- "This system is proven to work"
- "Research shows this system improves outcomes"
- "This system guarantees results"
- "This system is evidence-based"
- "This system is better than other approaches"

**Why:** This language creates risk. It makes claims that cannot be supported and may be challenged.

---

### Inspection Language Checklist

Before describing the system to inspectors, check:

- [ ] No outcome guarantees
- [ ] No causal language
- [ ] No predictive claims
- [ ] No comparative claims
- [ ] No efficacy claims
- [ ] Focus on creating conditions
- [ ] Focus on principles and frameworks
- [ ] Acknowledge that outcomes vary

If any answer is "no," revise the language.

## How Staff, Leaders, Marketing, and AI Must Speak About the System

### Staff Language

**Staff should say:**
- "This system helps me understand how to create supportive environments"
- "I use trauma-informed principles to inform my practice"
- "This system provides frameworks that guide my responses"
- "I adapt the system to my context and role"

**Staff should NOT say:**
- "This system works"
- "This system improves outcomes"
- "This system is proven"
- "This system guarantees results"

---

### Leader Language

**Leaders should say:**
- "We use a trauma-informed approach to inform our system design"
- "This system helps us create supportive environments for all children"
- "We adapt the system to our context and needs"
- "We focus on creating conditions that support learning and regulation"

**Leaders should NOT say:**
- "This system is proven to work"
- "Research shows this system improves outcomes"
- "This system guarantees results"
- "This system is evidence-based"

---

### Marketing Language

**Marketing should say:**
- "An evidence-informed framework for creating supportive school environments"
- "Draws on principles from trauma-informed education research"
- "Supports schools to create safe, predictable environments"
- "A framework that schools adapt to their context"

**Marketing should NOT say:**
- "Proven to work"
- "Evidence-based intervention"
- "Guarantees results"
- "Improves outcomes"
- "Better than other approaches"

---

### AI Language

**AI should say:**
- "This system provides frameworks and principles"
- "This system focuses on creating supportive conditions"
- "This system is evidence-informed, not evidence-based"
- "Outcomes vary based on many factors"

**AI should NOT say:**
- "This system works"
- "This system improves outcomes"
- "This system is proven"
- "This system guarantees results"
- "Research shows this system..."

## What to Do When Someone Asks for Proof or Impact Data

### When Asked for Proof

**Request:** "Can you prove this system works?"

**Response:** "This system is evidence-informed, drawing on principles from trauma-informed education research. It is not an evidence-based intervention with research-proven outcomes. We focus on creating supportive conditions and learning from experience. Outcomes vary based on many factors."

**What to offer:**
- Explanation of evidence-informed approach
- Description of principles and frameworks
- Examples of system changes
- Learning from experience

**What NOT to offer:**
- Research studies or citations
- Outcome data or statistics
- Proof of effectiveness
- Evidence of causation

---

### When Asked for Impact Data

**Request:** "What impact data do you have?"

**Response:** "We don't collect impact data or outcome measures. This system focuses on creating supportive conditions and system changes, not on measuring individual outcomes. We measure system changes, such as increased predictability or improved adult regulation, not child outcomes."

**What to offer:**
- Description of system changes
- Examples of practice improvements
- Learning from experience
- Focus on conditions, not outcomes

**What NOT to offer:**
- Outcome data or statistics
- Impact measurements
- Proof of effectiveness
- Evidence of outcomes

---

### When Asked for Research Evidence

**Request:** "What research evidence supports this system?"

**Response:** "This system draws on principles from trauma-informed education research, but it is not a research-proven intervention. Research informs the principles and frameworks, but does not prove that this specific system works or produces specific outcomes. We are evidence-informed, not evidence-based."

**What to offer:**
- Explanation of research domains that inform the system
- Description of principles drawn from research
- Clarification of evidence-informed vs evidence-based
- Focus on frameworks, not research validation

**What NOT to offer:**
- Research citations or studies
- Proof of research validation
- Evidence-based claims
- Research-proven outcomes
