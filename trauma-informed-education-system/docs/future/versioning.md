# Versioning

## Purpose

This document defines what "V1" means, how future versions are handled, backward compatibility principles, what triggers a new version, and how schools know what version they are using.

---

## What "V1" Means (Complete, Usable, Not Provisional)

### V1 Is Complete

**Complete:** V1 is a complete, usable system. It is not provisional, incomplete, or in development.

**Usable:** Schools can use V1 immediately and independently. No waiting for completion or updates.

**Not provisional:** V1 is not a draft, beta, or prototype. It is a finished system ready for use.

---

### What V1 Includes

**V1 includes:**
- All foundational principles and language definitions
- Complete framework (pillars, roles, processes)
- All 8 delivery modules
- Implementation cycles and reflection tools
- AI guardrails and prompt schemas
- Governance and safeguarding boundaries
- Evidence and claims discipline
- Business model and engagement tiers

**V1 is:** A complete, self-contained system that schools can use independently.

---

### V1 Is Not Provisional

**V1 is NOT:**
- A draft or beta version
- Incomplete or under development
- Waiting for future updates
- Dependent on future versions

**Why:** V1 is complete and usable. Schools can use it immediately without waiting for updates.

---

## How Future Versions Are Handled (V2, V3…) Without Invalidating V1

### V1 Remains Valid

**V1 validity:** V1 remains valid, usable, and complete regardless of future versions.

**No invalidation:** Future versions do not invalidate V1. Schools can continue using V1 indefinitely.

**No requirement to upgrade:** Schools are not required to upgrade to future versions. V1 works independently.

---

### Version Independence

**Each version is independent:**
- V1 works independently
- V2 (if created) would work independently
- Versions do not depend on each other
- Schools choose which version to use

**Why:** Version independence protects schools from forced changes or updates.

---

### Backward Compatibility

**Backward compatibility:** Future versions maintain backward compatibility with V1 principles and frameworks.

**What this means:**
- V1 principles remain valid
- V1 frameworks remain usable
- V1 materials remain accessible
- V1 practices remain appropriate

**Why:** Backward compatibility protects schools from disruption or invalidation.

---

## Backward Compatibility Principles

### Principles Remain Stable

**Stability:** Core principles remain stable across versions. They do not change fundamentally.

**What this means:**
- V1 principles inform future versions
- Future versions build on V1, not replace it
- Principles evolve slowly, not dramatically
- No sudden shifts or reversals

**Why:** Stable principles protect schools from confusion or disruption.

---

### Frameworks Remain Usable

**Usability:** V1 frameworks remain usable regardless of future versions.

**What this means:**
- V1 frameworks continue to work
- Future versions may add frameworks, not remove V1
- Schools can use V1 frameworks indefinitely
- No forced migration or replacement

**Why:** Usable frameworks protect schools from forced changes or updates.

---

### Materials Remain Accessible

**Accessibility:** V1 materials remain accessible regardless of future versions.

**What this means:**
- V1 materials are preserved
- Future versions add materials, not remove V1
- Schools can access V1 materials indefinitely
- No forced migration or replacement

**Why:** Accessible materials protect schools from loss or disruption.

## What Triggers a New Version vs a Patch

### What Triggers a New Version

**New version triggers:**
- Fundamental changes to principles or frameworks
- Significant additions that change system scope
- Changes that affect backward compatibility
- Major structural or architectural changes

**Examples:**
- New core principles or frameworks
- Significant new modules or processes
- Changes to governance or safeguarding boundaries
- Major evidence or claims discipline changes

**Why:** New versions signal significant changes that schools should be aware of.

---

### What Triggers a Patch

**Patch triggers:**
- Corrections or clarifications
- Minor updates or refinements
- Typo fixes or formatting improvements
- Non-substantive changes

**Examples:**
- Typo corrections
- Clarification of language
- Formatting improvements
- Minor refinements

**Why:** Patches address minor issues without creating new versions.

---

### What Does NOT Trigger a Version Change

**Does NOT trigger:**
- Regular updates or improvements
- Trend-chasing or moral panic responses
- Pressure to change or update
- New research or evidence (unless fundamental)

**Why:** Version changes are rare and significant. They are not driven by trends or pressure.

---

## Explicit Refusal of "Constant Updating" Culture

### What "Constant Updating" Means

**Constant updating:** Expectation of regular updates, improvements, or changes to the system.

**Why this is refused:** Constant updating creates dependency, disruption, and instability. It prevents schools from settling into practice.

---

### How to Refuse

**Language:** "This system is complete at V1. It does not require constant updates or changes. Schools can use it independently without waiting for updates."

**Boundaries:** Clear boundaries about update frequency and triggers. Updates are rare and significant, not constant.

**Redirection:** Redirect to V1 materials and practice, not future updates or improvements.

---

### What This Means for Schools

**Schools understand:**
- V1 is complete and usable
- Updates are rare and significant
- No expectation of constant changes
- System works without updates

**Schools do NOT expect:**
- Regular updates or improvements
- Constant changes or refinements
- New features or additions
- Ongoing development or evolution

---

## How Schools Know What Version They Are Using

### Version Identification

**How to identify:**
- Version number in document headers
- Version statement in README
- Version markers in materials
- Clear version labeling

**What schools see:**
- "Version 1" or "V1" in document headers
- Version statement: "This system is complete at V1"
- Version markers throughout materials
- Clear version identification

---

### Version Documentation

**Documentation includes:**
- Version number and date
- What is included in this version
- What is NOT included in this version
- How to use this version

**What schools know:**
- Which version they are using
- What is included in their version
- How to use their version
- That their version is complete and usable

---

### Version Stability

**Stability:** Versions are stable. They do not change after release.

**What this means:**
- V1 remains V1
- No changes to released versions
- Patches are documented separately
- New versions are clearly marked

**Why:** Version stability protects schools from confusion or disruption.

---

## Version Principles Summary

### V1 Principles

**V1 is:**
- Complete and usable
- Not provisional or in development
- Independent and self-contained
- Valid indefinitely

**V1 does NOT:**
- Require updates or changes
- Depend on future versions
- Become invalid over time
- Require constant maintenance

---

### Future Version Principles

**Future versions:**
- Are rare and significant
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Do not invalidate V1
- Are independent and optional

**Future versions do NOT:**
- Require schools to upgrade
- Invalidate previous versions
- Create dependency or disruption
- Follow constant updating culture
