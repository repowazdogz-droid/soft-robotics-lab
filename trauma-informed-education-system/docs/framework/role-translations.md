# Translating Trauma-Informed Principles Across Roles

## Purpose

This document prevents role confusion and overload by clarifying what trauma-informed practice means for different stakeholders. Same principles, different responsibilities. No one becomes a therapist. Everyone understands their role.

---

## Why Role Translation Matters

### Same Principles, Different Responsibilities

The principles of trauma-informed practice apply to everyone, but how they apply depends on your role. A teacher's responsibility is different from a leader's responsibility. A support staff member's responsibility is different from a parent's responsibility.

### Prevents Overreach and Avoidance

Without clear role translation, people either overreach (trying to do things beyond their role) or avoid (thinking trauma-informed practice isn't their responsibility). Clear role translation prevents both.

## Leadership (Heads, SLT, Governors)

### What is Expected

**System design:** Leaders design systems that support relational safety, predictability, adult regulation, and repair. This includes policies, processes, structures, and culture.

**Resource allocation:** Leaders allocate resources to support trauma-informed practice. This includes time, staffing, training, and support.

**Support for adults:** Leaders support adults so adults can support children. This includes recognising stress, providing support, and protecting capacity.

**Culture and tone:** Leaders set the tone and culture of the school. This includes how mistakes are handled, how support is offered, and how relationships are prioritised.

**Boundaries and processes:** Leaders establish clear boundaries and processes that protect everyone. This includes safeguarding, escalation, and professional boundaries.

### What is Explicitly NOT Expected

**Clinical expertise:** Leaders are not expected to be trauma experts, therapists, or clinical specialists. They are expected to create systems that support practice, not to provide clinical interventions.

**Direct work with children:** Leaders are not expected to work directly with children on trauma-informed practice. They are expected to support the adults who do.

**Perfect implementation:** Leaders are not expected to implement trauma-informed practice perfectly. They are expected to create systems that support ongoing learning and improvement.

**Individual case management:** Leaders are not expected to manage individual cases or provide therapeutic support. They are expected to ensure systems support appropriate responses.

### Key System Decisions That Matter Most

**How do we support adult regulation?** This is the most important system decision. Without adult regulation, nothing else works.

**How do we create predictability?** This includes routines, transitions, responses, and expectations. Predictability reduces stress and supports regulation.

**How do we support repair?** This includes processes, language, and culture that support repair when things go wrong.

**How do we protect boundaries?** This includes clear professional boundaries, safeguarding processes, and escalation pathways.

**How do we allocate resources?** This includes time, staffing, training, and support that enable trauma-informed practice.

## Teachers & Classroom Staff

### What Trauma-Informed Looks Like Day-to-Day

**Relational safety:** Creating safe, consistent relationships with children. Responding with attunement, not control. Repairing ruptures quickly.

**Predictability:** Maintaining clear routines, transitions, and responses. Communicating expectations clearly. Providing advance notice of changes.

**Adult regulation:** Noticing your own stress and regulating yourself. Using strategies to manage stress. Asking for support when needed.

**Repair and learning:** Acknowledging mistakes and repairing quickly. Reflecting on what worked and what didn't. Learning from experience.

### Boundaries of Responsibility

**Your responsibility:**
- Creating safe, predictable classroom environments
- Supporting children's regulation through your own regulation
- Responding to need, not just behaviour
- Repairing ruptures in relationships
- Following safeguarding procedures

**Not your responsibility:**
- Diagnosing or assessing trauma
- Providing therapeutic interventions
- Managing individual cases beyond your role
- Working outside your professional boundaries
- Taking responsibility for things beyond your control

### What Support You Are Entitled To

**System support:** Systems that reduce stress load and support your regulation. This includes manageable workloads, clear processes, and adequate resources.

**Professional support:** Support from leaders, colleagues, and external professionals when needed. This includes supervision, consultation, and training.

**Personal support:** Recognition that you are human, with finite capacity. Support when you are stressed or overwhelmed. Protection from unsustainable demands.

**Learning support:** Opportunities to learn and develop practice. This includes training, reflection, and collaboration.

## Support Staff (TAs, Pastoral, Admin)

### Often Overlooked Roles

Support staff are often overlooked in trauma-informed practice, but they are essential. They create the tone, predictability, and safety that enable everything else.

### Predictability and Tone

**Predictability:** Support staff create predictability through consistent routines, responses, and communication. They maintain the structures that support everyone.

**Tone:** Support staff set the tone through their interactions, language, and presence. They create the atmosphere that supports or undermines trauma-informed practice.

**Consistency:** Support staff provide consistency across different contexts. They maintain routines and processes even when others don't.

### Information Boundaries

**What you need to know:** Information necessary to support children safely and effectively. This includes relevant context, not everything.

**What you don't need to know:** Detailed personal information, clinical assessments, or sensitive information beyond your role.

**How to handle information:** Follow confidentiality and safeguarding procedures. Share information appropriately. Protect privacy while supporting safety.

### Your Role in Trauma-Informed Practice

**Creating safety:** Your consistent, predictable presence creates safety. Your attuned responses support regulation.

**Supporting adults:** You support teachers and leaders so they can support children. You reduce stress load where possible.

**Maintaining systems:** You maintain the systems and processes that support trauma-informed practice. You keep things running smoothly.

**Protecting boundaries:** You protect professional boundaries and follow safeguarding procedures. You know when to escalate.

## Parents & Carers

### Shared Language, Not Shared Roles

Parents and schools share language about trauma-informed practice, but they have different roles. Schools support children in school contexts. Parents support children in home contexts. Neither replaces the other.

### What Schools Should Ask of Parents

**Communication:** Clear, respectful communication about what's happening at school and what support is needed.

**Consistency:** Where possible, consistency between home and school approaches. This doesn't mean identical approaches, but shared principles.

**Partnership:** Working together to support children, recognising that both home and school matter.

**Boundaries:** Respecting professional boundaries and safeguarding procedures. Understanding what schools can and cannot do.

### What Schools Should NOT Ask of Parents

**Therapeutic interventions:** Schools should not ask parents to provide therapeutic interventions or clinical support.

**Diagnosis or assessment:** Schools should not ask parents to diagnose or assess their children's needs.

**Excessive responsibility:** Schools should not ask parents to take responsibility for things that are the school's responsibility.

**Compliance:** Schools should not ask parents to comply with approaches that don't work for their family.

### How Parents Can Support Trauma-Informed Practice

**Understanding:** Understanding what trauma-informed practice means and how it applies to schools.

**Communication:** Communicating clearly with schools about what's happening at home and what support is needed.

**Consistency:** Where possible, creating consistency between home and school approaches.

**Partnership:** Working together with schools to support children, recognising different roles and responsibilities.

## External Professionals

### How This System Interfaces with Therapy, CAMHS, Social Care

**Clear handoffs:** Clear processes for sharing information and coordinating support. This includes what information is shared, how it's shared, and who's responsible.

**Different roles:** Recognition that schools, therapy, CAMHS, and social care have different roles. Schools support children in school contexts. Therapy supports children therapeutically. CAMHS provides clinical support. Social care provides safeguarding and family support.

**No substitution:** Schools do not substitute for therapy, CAMHS, or social care. Schools support children in school contexts while other professionals support in their contexts.

**Coordination:** Where appropriate, coordination between different professionals. This includes shared understanding, clear communication, and coordinated support.

### Clear Handoffs, No Substitution

**When to hand off:** Clear criteria for when schools hand off to external professionals. This includes safeguarding concerns, clinical needs, and family support needs.

**How to hand off:** Clear processes for handing off to external professionals. This includes what information is shared, how it's shared, and who's responsible.

**What happens after handoff:** Clear understanding of what happens after handoff. This includes ongoing communication, coordination, and support.

**Boundaries:** Clear boundaries about what schools can and cannot do. Schools do not provide therapy, clinical assessment, or social care.
