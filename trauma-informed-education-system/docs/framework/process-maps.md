# Core Trauma-Informed Processes (Non-Clinical)

## Purpose

This document describes repeatable processes that can be adopted without specialist training. These processes are light-weight, practical, and inspection-safe. They focus on adult actions and system responses, not therapeutic techniques.

---

## Process Design Principles

### Light-Weight

Processes should be simple enough to use under pressure. They should not require extensive training, complex tools, or perfect conditions.

### Repeatable

Processes should be consistent enough to be repeated reliably, but flexible enough to adapt to context. They should not be scripts to follow verbatim.

### Inspection-Safe

Processes should be safe under inspection. They should not sound clinical, therapeutic, or pathologising. They should be clear, professional, and appropriate.

### Human-Centred

Processes should support humans, not replace them. They should enhance professional judgment, not replace it. They should be tools, not rules.

## Process: Responding to Dysregulation (Adult-Led)

### Purpose

This process guides adults in responding to children who are experiencing stress or overload. It focuses on adult actions, not child behaviour management.

### Before: Preparation

**Notice your own state:** Before responding, notice your own stress, energy, and capacity. Regulate yourself first.

**Consider context:** What's happening? What might be contributing? What's the child's usual pattern?

**Prepare your response:** How will you respond? What support do you need? What boundaries are important?

**Key principle:** You cannot support regulation if you are dysregulated. Regulate yourself first.

### During: Response

**Attune, don't control:** Notice what's happening. Respond to need, not just behaviour. Be present, not directive.

**Reduce demands:** Reduce cognitive, emotional, or social demands. Simplify the environment. Provide space if needed.

**Maintain safety:** Keep everyone safe. This includes physical safety, emotional safety, and relational safety.

**Stay regulated:** Continue to regulate yourself. Your regulated state supports the child's regulation.

**Key principle:** Support regulation through your own regulation. Attune to need, not control behaviour.

### After: Recovery and Reflection

**Allow recovery time:** Regulation takes time. Don't rush to "fix" or "move on." Allow time for recovery.

**Repair if needed:** If there was a rupture, repair it. Acknowledge what happened. Restore relationship.

**Reflect:** What happened? What worked? What didn't? What can we learn?

**Plan:** How can we support this child better? What changes might help? What support is needed?

**Key principle:** Recovery and reflection are part of the process, not separate from it.

### What NOT to Do

**Don't escalate:** Don't match the child's energy or escalate the situation. Stay regulated.

**Don't take it personally:** The child's response is about their need, not your failure. Don't take it personally.

**Don't rush:** Don't rush to "fix" or "move on." Regulation takes time.

**Don't blame:** Don't blame the child, yourself, or others. Focus on need and support.

**Don't isolate:** Don't isolate the child unnecessarily. Support regulation while maintaining connection.

## Process: Repair After Rupture

### Purpose

This process guides repair when relationships or trust are broken. It focuses on acknowledgment, responsibility, and restoration.

### Why Repair Matters

Ruptures—breaks in relationship or trust—are normal and repairable. Repair restores relationship, builds trust, and supports learning. Without repair, ruptures accumulate and relationships break down.

### Minimal Repair Language

**Acknowledge:** "I notice that [what happened]. I'm sorry that happened."

**Take responsibility:** "I take responsibility for [your part]. I should have [what you should have done]."

**Understand:** "Help me understand what happened from your perspective."

**Restore:** "How can we move forward? What do you need?"

**Key principle:** Repair requires acknowledgment, responsibility, and action. It doesn't require perfection.

### Timing Rules

**As soon as possible:** Repair as soon as it's safe and appropriate. Don't wait for "the right time."

**When regulated:** Repair when both people are regulated enough to engage. Don't repair in the heat of the moment.

**When ready:** Repair when both people are ready. Don't force repair before people are ready.

**Key principle:** Timing matters. Repair too early or too late is less effective. Repair when it's safe, appropriate, and both people are ready.

### What Repair Looks Like

**Acknowledgment:** Recognising what happened and its impact. Not minimising or avoiding.

**Responsibility:** Taking responsibility for your part. Not blaming or deflecting.

**Understanding:** Seeking to understand the other person's perspective. Not assuming or judging.

**Action:** Taking action to restore relationship and prevent recurrence. Not just apologising.

**Key principle:** Repair is a process, not an event. It takes time and ongoing attention.

## Process: Staff Reflection & Load-Reduction

### Purpose

This process supports staff to reflect on practice and reduce stress load. It focuses on learning and support, not performance or compliance.

### Micro-Reflection

**What happened?** Brief description of what happened. Not detailed analysis, just what happened.

**What worked?** What went well? What supported? What helped?

**What didn't?** What didn't work? What was challenging? What didn't help?

**What can we learn?** What can we learn from this? What might we do differently?

**Key principle:** Reflection should be brief, focused, and useful. It doesn't need to be extensive or perfect.

### No Performance Framing

**Learning, not performance:** Reflection is about learning, not performance. It's not about proving competence or avoiding mistakes.

**Support, not judgment:** Reflection should feel supportive, not judgmental. It's about learning together, not evaluating individually.

**Optional, not mandatory:** Reflection should feel optional, not mandatory. It should be helpful, not burdensome.

**Key principle:** Reflection supports learning when it feels safe and useful. It doesn't support learning when it feels like performance evaluation.

### Optional, Not Mandatory

**Invitation, not requirement:** Reflection should be an invitation, not a requirement. People should feel free to engage or not.

**Support, not compliance:** Reflection should feel supportive, not like compliance. It should help, not burden.

**Flexible, not fixed:** Reflection should be flexible, not fixed. It should adapt to context and need.

**Key principle:** Reflection supports learning when it's optional and supportive. It doesn't support learning when it's mandatory and evaluative.

### Load-Reduction Focus

**What's creating stress?** What's creating stress or overload? What's increasing load?

**What can we reduce?** What can we reduce or simplify? What can we remove or change?

**What support is needed?** What support is needed to reduce load? What resources or help?

**Key principle:** Load-reduction is about reducing stress and increasing support, not just teaching techniques.

## Process: Escalation & Safeguarding Boundary

### Purpose

This process defines clear stop lines for when this system hands off to safeguarding, clinical, or other professional systems.

### Clear Stop Lines

**Safeguarding concerns:** Any concerns about harm, abuse, or neglect. These must be escalated immediately through safeguarding procedures.

**Clinical needs:** Any needs that require clinical assessment or intervention. These must be escalated to appropriate clinical services.

**Crisis situations:** Any situations that require immediate intervention or support. These must be escalated to appropriate emergency or crisis services.

**Key principle:** Stop lines are non-negotiable. When stop lines are reached, this system hands off to appropriate professional systems.

### When This System Hands Off

**To safeguarding:** When there are safeguarding concerns. Schools follow safeguarding procedures and hand off to safeguarding services.

**To clinical services:** When there are clinical needs. Schools support children while clinical services assess and intervene.

**To crisis services:** When there are crisis situations. Schools support children while crisis services provide immediate intervention.

**Key principle:** Handoffs are clear and coordinated. Schools support children while other services provide their support.

### Documentation Boundaries

**What to document:** What's necessary for safeguarding, support, and coordination. Not everything, just what's necessary.

**How to document:** Clearly, factually, and professionally. Not judgmentally, clinically, or pathologising.

**Who sees documentation:** Those who need to know for safeguarding, support, and coordination. Not everyone, just those who need to know.

**Key principle:** Documentation should support safeguarding, support, and coordination. It should not create unnecessary risk or harm.

## Process Integrity Check

Use this checklist to ensure processes haven't drifted into therapy or compliance theatre:

### Process Integrity Questions

- [ ] **Is this process light-weight and practical?** Can it be used under pressure without extensive training?

- [ ] **Is this process repeatable but flexible?** Can it be repeated reliably while adapting to context?

- [ ] **Is this process inspection-safe?** Would you be comfortable explaining this process in an inspection?

- [ ] **Is this process human-centred?** Does it support professional judgment, not replace it?

- [ ] **Does this process focus on adult actions?** Does it guide adult actions, not child behaviour management?

- [ ] **Does this process avoid therapeutic techniques?** Does it avoid clinical or therapeutic interventions?

- [ ] **Does this process support learning?** Does it support learning and improvement, not just compliance?

- [ ] **Does this process respect boundaries?** Does it respect professional boundaries and safeguarding procedures?

### Red Flags

**If a process:**
- Requires extensive training or specialist knowledge
- Provides scripts to follow verbatim
- Focuses on fixing or treating children
- Sounds clinical or therapeutic
- Creates compliance without understanding
- Blurs professional boundaries
- Replaces professional judgment

**Then it has drifted.** Revise the process to restore integrity.

## How Processes Support Practice

Processes support practice by:
- **Providing structure:** Clear structure for common situations
- **Reducing cognitive load:** Less decision-making under pressure
- **Supporting consistency:** Consistent approaches across contexts
- **Enabling learning:** Opportunities to reflect and improve
- **Protecting boundaries:** Clear boundaries and escalation pathways

Processes do not replace professional judgment. They support it.
