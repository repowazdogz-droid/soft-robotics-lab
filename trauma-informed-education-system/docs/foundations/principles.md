# Trauma-Informed Education — Foundational Principles (V1)

## Purpose

This document defines the non-negotiable principles that govern all design, delivery, and AI use in this system. These principles override convenience, growth, and revenue. If any decision conflicts with these principles, the principles win.

These principles are written in plain language for teachers and leaders under pressure. They are designed to be school-safe under inspection and explicitly non-therapeutic.

## What "Trauma-Informed" Means Here

**This system is not therapy.** We do not diagnose, treat, or fix children. We do not provide clinical interventions or therapeutic techniques.

**This system is not about trauma.** We are not trauma experts, trauma therapists, or trauma specialists. We do not assess trauma, identify trauma, or work with trauma directly.

**This system is about environments.** We design school environments that reduce harm and increase safety. We support adults to create conditions where children can learn, regulate, and connect.

**This system is about adults.** We support teachers, leaders, and support staff. When adults feel safer, more regulated, and more connected, children benefit. We do not work directly with children.

**This system is about systems.** We focus on how schools operate, not on individual children. We change systems, not children.

## Core Principles

### 1. Safety (Psychological, Relational, Systemic)

**What it means:** Safety is the foundation. Without safety, nothing else works. Safety means feeling secure enough to learn, connect, and make mistakes.

**Practical implications:**
- Adults must feel safe before they can create safety for children
- Safety is built through consistent, predictable responses, not perfect responses
- Safety includes psychological safety (feeling heard, not shamed), relational safety (trusting connections), and systemic safety (clear boundaries and processes)

**Adult actions:**
- Notice when you feel unsafe or overwhelmed
- Create predictable routines and responses
- Repair ruptures quickly and clearly
- Protect boundaries without shame

---

### 2. Predictability

**What it means:** Predictable environments reduce stress. When people know what to expect, they can prepare, regulate, and engage.

**Practical implications:**
- Consistency matters more than perfection
- Clear routines reduce cognitive load for everyone
- Predictable responses build trust
- Surprises should be positive, not stressful

**Adult actions:**
- Establish and maintain clear routines
- Communicate changes in advance when possible
- Respond consistently to similar situations
- Explain processes and expectations clearly

---

### 3. Agency & Choice

**What it means:** People need to feel they have some control over their experience. Agency reduces helplessness and increases engagement.

**Practical implications:**
- Offer choices within boundaries
- Explain the "why" behind requirements
- Allow adults to adapt approaches to their context
- Respect "no" when it's safe to do so

**Adult actions:**
- Offer meaningful choices where possible
- Explain reasons for non-negotiable requirements
- Adapt approaches to fit your context
- Respect boundaries and refusals appropriately

---

### 4. Attunement Over Control

**What it means:** Responding to what's actually happening matters more than enforcing what should be happening. Attunement means noticing, understanding, and responding appropriately.

**Practical implications:**
- Notice what's happening before deciding what to do
- Respond to need, not just behaviour
- Flexibility within structure
- Connection before correction

**Adult actions:**
- Pause to notice before reacting
- Ask "what's happening here?" before "what should I do?"
- Respond to the person, not just the behaviour
- Connect before correcting

---

### 5. Repair Over Punishment

**What it means:** When things go wrong, repair the relationship and the situation. Punishment rarely teaches what we want it to teach.

**Practical implications:**
- Mistakes and ruptures are normal and repairable
- Repair requires acknowledgment, understanding, and action
- Consequences should teach, not punish
- Relationships can survive conflict when repair happens

**Adult actions:**
- Acknowledge when things go wrong
- Take responsibility for your part
- Work together to repair and move forward
- Use consequences that teach, not shame

---

### 6. Adults First, Children Benefit

**What it means:** When adults feel regulated, supported, and safe, children benefit. We cannot give what we do not have.

**Practical implications:**
- Support adults to regulate themselves first
- Create systems that support adult wellbeing
- Model the behaviours we want to see
- Recognise that adult stress impacts children

**Adult actions:**
- Notice your own regulation and stress
- Use strategies to regulate yourself
- Ask for support when you need it
- Recognise that your state affects children

---

### 7. Systems Over Individuals

**What it means:** Most problems are systemic, not individual. Change systems, not people.

**Practical implications:**
- Look for patterns, not just incidents
- Question whether the system is working, not just whether individuals are
- Design systems that prevent problems
- Support individuals within better systems

**Adult actions:**
- Notice patterns across situations
- Question system design, not just individual behaviour
- Work together to improve systems
- Support individuals while changing systems

---

## What This System Refuses to Do

### Pathologise Behaviour

We do not label children as "traumatised," "dysregulated," or "problematic." We do not diagnose or assess. We notice behaviour, understand context, and respond appropriately.

**Instead:** We describe what we observe, consider context, and respond to need.

---

### Individualise Systemic Failure

We do not blame individuals for systemic problems. When many children struggle, the system needs attention, not the children.

**Instead:** We look for systemic patterns and improve systems.

---

### Replace Safeguarding

We do not replace safeguarding procedures, child protection protocols, or professional responsibilities. We support adults to fulfil their safeguarding duties more effectively.

**Instead:** We support adults to recognise safeguarding concerns and follow procedures appropriately.

---

### Outsource Responsibility to Tools or Scripts

We do not provide scripts, tools, or techniques that replace professional judgment. We support adults to make better decisions, not to follow instructions.

**Instead:** We provide frameworks, principles, and reflection tools that support professional judgment.

## How These Principles Apply

These principles apply to:
- All system design decisions
- All AI interactions and responses
- All documentation and materials
- All training and support
- All business decisions

If any decision conflicts with these principles, the principles win. This is non-negotiable.

## Version

This is Version 1. These principles may evolve based on learning and feedback, but any changes will be documented and explained.
