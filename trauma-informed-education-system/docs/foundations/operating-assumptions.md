# Operating Assumptions

## Purpose

This document makes hidden beliefs explicit so the system stays coherent under pressure. When we make decisions, these assumptions guide us. When we face dilemmas, these assumptions help us choose.

These assumptions are not facts. They are beliefs we hold based on experience and evidence. Making them explicit helps us stay consistent and accountable.

## About Children

### Behaviour as Communication

**Assumption:** Children's behaviour communicates need, not defiance. When behaviour is challenging, something is needed, not wrong.

**Implication:** We respond to need, not just behaviour. We ask "what's needed here?" before "what's wrong here?"

**What this means for adults:**
- Notice what behaviour might be communicating
- Consider what need might be unmet
- Respond to need, not just behaviour
- Recognise that communication can be indirect

---

### Developmental Variability

**Assumption:** Children develop at different rates and in different ways. Stress, adversity, and context affect development.

**Implication:** We do not expect all children to be at the same stage. We meet children where they are, not where they should be.

**What this means for adults:**
- Adjust expectations to match developmental stage, not chronological age
- Recognise that stress affects development
- Support development without shaming delay
- Provide appropriate scaffolding and support

---

### Stress Impacts Regulation and Learning

**Assumption:** When children are stressed, their capacity to regulate emotions and learn decreases. This is normal, not pathological.

**Implication:** We create environments that reduce stress and support regulation. We do not expect stressed children to perform as if unstressed.

**What this means for adults:**
- Recognise signs of stress and overload
- Reduce demands when stress is high
- Support regulation before learning
- Create conditions that reduce stress

---

## About Adults

### Capacity is Finite

**Assumption:** Adults have limited capacity. When capacity is exceeded, performance decreases, stress increases, and mistakes happen.

**Implication:** We design systems that respect adult capacity. We support adults to manage their capacity effectively.

**What this means for adults:**
- Notice your own capacity and limits
- Protect your capacity where possible
- Ask for support before capacity is exceeded
- Recognise that capacity varies day to day

---

### Stress Precedes Skill Loss

**Assumption:** When adults are stressed, their skills and judgment decrease. This is normal, not failure.

**Implication:** We support adults to regulate stress so they can access their skills. We do not blame adults for stress responses.

**What this means for adults:**
- Notice your own stress and its impact
- Use strategies to regulate stress
- Recognise that stress affects everyone
- Support colleagues who are stressed

---

### Adults Need Containment Before Technique

**Assumption:** Adults need to feel safe, supported, and contained before they can learn new techniques or change practice.

**Implication:** We create safety and support first, then offer techniques. We do not expect adults to learn under stress.

**What this means for adults:**
- Notice when you need containment, not just technique
- Seek support and safety first
- Recognise that learning requires safety
- Support colleagues to feel contained

---

## About Schools

### Schools are High-Load Systems

**Assumption:** Schools are complex, high-demand environments with many competing priorities and limited resources.

**Implication:** We design systems that work in high-load contexts. We do not expect schools to be low-stress environments.

**What this means for adults:**
- Recognise the complexity and demands of schools
- Design systems that work under pressure
- Simplify where possible
- Support each other in high-load contexts

---

### Consistency Beats Intensity

**Assumption:** Small, consistent actions over time create more change than intense, occasional interventions.

**Implication:** We prioritise sustainable, consistent practices over perfect, intensive ones.

**What this means for adults:**
- Choose practices you can sustain
- Consistency matters more than perfection
- Small shifts compound over time
- Avoid unsustainable intensity

---

### Most Harm is Unintentional

**Assumption:** Most harm in schools is unintentional. Adults usually intend to help, but systems and stress create unintended harm.

**Implication:** We focus on improving systems and reducing stress, not on blaming individuals. We repair unintentional harm.

**What this means for adults:**
- Recognise that harm can be unintentional
- Take responsibility for impact, not just intent
- Repair harm when it happens
- Improve systems to prevent harm

---

## About Change

### Small Shifts Compound

**Assumption:** Small, consistent changes create larger shifts over time. Dramatic change is rarely sustainable.

**Implication:** We focus on small, achievable shifts. We celebrate incremental progress.

**What this means for adults:**
- Start with small, achievable changes
- Recognise that small shifts matter
- Build on incremental progress
- Avoid overwhelming change

---

### Language Precedes Behaviour

**Assumption:** The language we use shapes how we think and act. Changing language changes behaviour.

**Implication:** We pay attention to language. We use language that supports the behaviours we want.

**What this means for adults:**
- Notice the language you use
- Choose language that supports your goals
- Change language to change thinking
- Be consistent in language use

---

### Systems Change Before Outcomes Change

**Assumption:** We must change systems before we see outcomes change. Outcomes lag behind system changes.

**Implication:** We focus on system changes, not immediate outcomes. We measure system changes, not just outcomes.

**What this means for adults:**
- Focus on changing systems
- Measure system changes
- Be patient with outcome changes
- Recognise that outcomes lag behind systems

---

## About This System

### This is an Operating System, Not a Programme

**Assumption:** This system provides a way of operating, not a fixed programme to follow. It adapts to context.

**Implication:** We provide frameworks and principles, not scripts. Adults adapt the system to their context.

**What this means for adults:**
- Adapt the system to your context
- Use principles, not scripts
- Make the system work for you
- Evolve the system based on learning

---

### Adoption > Compliance

**Assumption:** People adopt what they understand and value, not what they're told to do. Compliance without adoption doesn't work.

**Implication:** We support understanding and value, not just compliance. We explain why, not just what.

**What this means for adults:**
- Focus on understanding, not just doing
- Explain why things matter
- Support adoption, not just compliance
- Recognise that adoption takes time

---

### Reflection > Performance

**Assumption:** Reflection creates learning and change. Performance without reflection creates compliance without growth.

**Implication:** We prioritise reflection and learning over performance and perfection.

**What this means for adults:**
- Make time for reflection
- Learn from experience
- Focus on learning, not perfection
- Support reflection in others

## How These Assumptions Guide Decisions

When we face decisions, we check:
- Do our assumptions align with this decision?
- Does this decision honour our assumptions?
- What assumptions might we be making that we haven't made explicit?

When assumptions conflict with reality, we update our assumptions, not ignore reality.

## Version

This is Version 1. These assumptions may evolve based on learning and feedback, but any changes will be documented and explained.
