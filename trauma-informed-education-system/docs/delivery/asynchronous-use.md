# Asynchronous Use Guide

## Purpose

This document explains how trauma-informed education modules can be used asynchronously (self-paced, without live facilitation) while maintaining safety, boundaries, and effectiveness.

---

## Self-Paced Staff Use

### How It Works

**Individual completion:** Staff complete modules independently, at their own pace, in their own time.

**No live sessions required:** Modules are designed to be completed without live facilitation or group sessions.

**Optional reflection:** Reflection prompts are included but optional. No sharing or disclosure required.

**Support available:** Support may be available through school systems, but modules can be completed independently.

---

### Guidelines for Self-Paced Use

**Time flexibility:** Complete modules when you have time. There's no pressure to complete quickly.

**Pace flexibility:** Complete modules at your own pace. Break them into smaller chunks if needed.

**Optional activities:** Activities are optional. Complete them if helpful, skip them if not.

**No sharing required:** You don't need to share reflections or activities with anyone. They're for your learning only.

**Support available:** If you need support, ask. But modules can be completed independently.

---

### Quality Control for Self-Paced Use

**Before use:**
- Review module purpose and intended audience
- Ensure you have time and capacity
- Understand that modules are optional

**During use:**
- Complete at your own pace
- Use optional activities if helpful
- Take breaks when needed
- Stop if overwhelmed

**After use:**
- Reflect on learning (optional)
- Apply learning in practice (as appropriate)
- Ask for support if needed

## Leadership-Only Use

### How It Works

**Leaders complete modules:** Leaders complete modules relevant to their role (particularly Module 2: Leadership & Systems).

**System design focus:** Leaders use modules to inform system design decisions.

**No staff requirement:** Leaders don't require staff to complete modules. They use modules to support their own practice.

**Optional staff use:** Staff may choose to complete modules, but it's not required.

---

### Guidelines for Leadership Use

**Focus on systems:** Use modules to inform system design, not to require staff compliance.

**Model principles:** Use modules to model trauma-informed principles in leadership practice.

**Support, don't require:** Support staff who choose to use modules, but don't require completion.

**Protect capacity:** Use modules to protect staff capacity, not to add demands.

---

### Quality Control for Leadership Use

**Before use:**
- Review module purpose and intended audience
- Understand leadership responsibilities
- Plan how to use learning in system design

**During use:**
- Focus on system design
- Consider practical implications
- Protect staff capacity

**After use:**
- Apply learning to system design
- Support staff without pressure
- Protect boundaries

## Parent-Facing Adaptation Rules

### What Can Be Adapted

**Language:** Language can be adapted to be parent-friendly while maintaining safety and boundaries.

**Examples:** "Creating predictable home environments" instead of "classroom predictability."

**Format:** Format can be adapted to be parent-friendly (shorter, simpler, more visual).

**Context:** Context can be adapted to home contexts while maintaining principles.

---

### What Cannot Be Adapted

**Principles:** Principles cannot be changed or diluted.

**Boundaries:** Boundaries cannot be relaxed or removed.

**Safeguarding:** Safeguarding procedures cannot be adapted or removed.

**Therapeutic content:** Therapeutic content cannot be added.

**Clinical language:** Clinical language cannot be added.

---

### Adaptation Guidelines

**Maintain safety:** All adaptations must maintain safety and boundaries.

**Maintain principles:** All adaptations must maintain trauma-informed principles.

**Maintain boundaries:** All adaptations must maintain professional boundaries.

**Review adaptations:** All adaptations should be reviewed for safety and appropriateness.

---

## What Cannot Be Adapted

### Non-Negotiable Elements

**Principles:** Trauma-informed principles cannot be changed or diluted.

**Boundaries:** Professional boundaries cannot be relaxed or removed.

**Safeguarding:** Safeguarding procedures cannot be adapted or removed.

**Language safety:** Language must remain safe under inspection.

**Non-therapeutic focus:** Modules must remain non-therapeutic.

---

### Why These Cannot Be Adapted

**Safety:** These elements protect safety and prevent harm.

**Effectiveness:** These elements ensure effectiveness and prevent drift.

**Boundaries:** These elements maintain professional boundaries.

**Compliance:** These elements ensure compliance with professional standards.
