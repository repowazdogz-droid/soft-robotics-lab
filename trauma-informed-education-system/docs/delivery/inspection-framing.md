# Inspection Framing

## Purpose

This document provides language and framing that schools can use when describing trauma-informed practice to inspectors, governors, and other stakeholders. This language is safe under inspection and maintains professional boundaries.

---

## How Schools Describe This to Inspectors

### Standard Description

**"We use a trauma-informed approach to create safe, predictable environments that support all children to learn and thrive. This means we focus on creating conditions that reduce stress and support regulation, rather than focusing on individual children or behaviour management. We support adults to create these conditions, which benefits all children."**

**Key points:**
- Focus on environments and conditions
- Support for adults, not direct work with children
- Non-clinical, non-therapeutic language
- Clear boundaries and focus

---

### Supporting Language

**"Trauma-informed practice helps us understand how stress affects learning and regulation. We use this understanding to create environments that reduce stress and support all children. We don't diagnose or assess trauma. We don't provide therapy. We create supportive environments."**

**"Our approach is based on principles of safety, predictability, adult regulation, and repair. These principles guide our system design and practice. They help us create conditions where all children can learn and thrive."**

---

## How It Sits Alongside Behaviour Policy

### Relationship to Behaviour Policy

**"Trauma-informed practice informs our behaviour policy and practice. It helps us understand that behaviour communicates need, and it guides us to respond to need rather than just manage behaviour. Our behaviour policy reflects trauma-informed principles while maintaining clear boundaries and expectations."**

**Key points:**
- Trauma-informed practice informs behaviour policy
- Focus on understanding need, not just managing behaviour
- Clear boundaries and expectations maintained
- Non-therapeutic, non-clinical approach

---

### Integration Language

**"We integrate trauma-informed principles into our behaviour policy and practice. This means we consider context, understand need, and respond appropriately while maintaining clear boundaries and expectations. Our approach is consistent with our behaviour policy and supports all children."**

---

## How It Supports Safeguarding (Non-Replacement)

### Relationship to Safeguarding

**"Trauma-informed practice supports our safeguarding work by helping staff recognise and respond to need appropriately. It does not replace safeguarding procedures or training. We follow safeguarding procedures first, always. Trauma-informed practice helps us create conditions that reduce harm and support appropriate responses."**

**Key points:**
- Supports safeguarding, does not replace it
- Safeguarding procedures come first, always
- Helps staff recognise and respond to need
- Creates conditions that reduce harm

---

### Safeguarding Language

**"Our trauma-informed approach helps staff understand how stress and adversity can affect children. This understanding supports our safeguarding work by helping staff recognise when children might need additional support or when safeguarding concerns might arise. We follow safeguarding procedures first, always."**

---

## What Claims Are NOT Made

### Explicit Non-Claims

**"We do not claim that trauma-informed practice:**
- Diagnoses or assesses trauma
- Provides therapy or therapeutic interventions
- Fixes or treats children
- Replaces safeguarding procedures
- Guarantees specific outcomes
- Works for all children in all situations"

**Why:** These claims would be inaccurate, unsafe, or inappropriate. Being explicit about non-claims protects everyone.

---

### Outcome Language

**"We use trauma-informed practice to create supportive environments. We don't promise specific outcomes. We focus on creating conditions that support learning and regulation. Outcomes vary based on many factors."**

## FAQ-Style Wording Leaders Can Reuse

### "What Is Trauma-Informed Practice?"

**Answer:** "Trauma-informed practice is an approach that recognises how stress and adversity can affect people and creates environments that reduce harm and increase safety. In schools, this means we focus on creating safe, predictable environments that support all children to learn and thrive. We support adults to create these conditions, which benefits all children."

---

### "How Does This Work in Practice?"

**Answer:** "We use trauma-informed principles to guide our system design and practice. This means we create predictable routines, support adult regulation, maintain clear boundaries, and repair relationships when things go wrong. We focus on creating conditions that support learning and regulation, rather than focusing on individual children or behaviour management."

---

### "Is This Therapy?"

**Answer:** "No. Trauma-informed practice is not therapy. We don't diagnose or assess trauma. We don't provide therapeutic interventions. We create supportive environments that reduce stress and support regulation. If children need therapy, we refer to appropriate professionals."

---

### "How Does This Relate to Safeguarding?"

**Answer:** "Trauma-informed practice supports our safeguarding work by helping staff recognise and respond to need appropriately. It does not replace safeguarding procedures or training. We follow safeguarding procedures first, always. Trauma-informed practice helps us create conditions that reduce harm and support appropriate responses."

---

### "What Are the Outcomes?"

**Answer:** "We don't promise specific outcomes. We focus on creating conditions that support learning and regulation. Outcomes vary based on many factors. We measure system changes, not just outcomes. We focus on creating supportive environments, not on fixing children."

---

### "How Do You Know It Works?"

**Answer:** "We measure system changes, such as increased predictability, improved adult regulation, and better repair processes. We don't measure individual child outcomes or claim causal relationships. We focus on creating supportive environments and learning from experience."

---

### "Is This Mandatory?"

**Answer:** "Trauma-informed practice is an approach we use, not a mandatory programme. Staff learn about principles and apply them in practice. We don't require specific compliance or outcomes. We support staff to use principles in ways that fit their context and role."

---

### "What Training Do Staff Receive?"

**Answer:** "Staff complete optional modules that introduce trauma-informed principles and language. These modules are self-paced and focus on professional practice, not personal disclosure. Staff learn about principles and apply them in practice. We don't require clinical training or therapeutic expertise."
