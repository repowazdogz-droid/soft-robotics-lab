## Optional Activities

### Activity 1: Language Check (5 minutes)

**Purpose:** Practice using safe, inspection-ready language

**Task:** Read a scenario and rewrite it using trauma-informed language that's safe under inspection.

**Example scenario:** "The traumatised child was triggered and had a meltdown."

**Safe rewrite:** "The child appeared to be experiencing stress and became overwhelmed."

**Guidelines:**
- Focus on description, not diagnosis
- Use approved terms from language definitions
- Avoid clinical or pathologising language
- No personal disclosure required

---

### Activity 2: Principle Application (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Consider how principles might apply to your practice

**Task:** Choose one principle and consider how it might apply to your role or context.

**Example:** "How might the principle of predictability apply to my classroom/routine/interactions?"

**Guidelines:**
- Focus on your role and context
- Consider practical applications
- No personal disclosure required
- No pressure to implement immediately

---

### Activity 3: Boundary Reflection (5 minutes)

**Purpose:** Understand what trauma-informed practice does not include

**Task:** Review "What This System Refuses to Do" and consider why these boundaries matter.

**Guidelines:**
- Focus on understanding boundaries
- Consider why boundaries protect everyone
- No personal disclosure required

## Common Misuse Patterns + Redirection

### Misuse: Using Clinical Language

**Pattern:** Staff use clinical terms like "traumatised," "triggered," or "dysregulated" as labels.

**Redirection:** Use descriptive language instead. "Child experiencing stress" not "traumatised child." "Overwhelmed" not "triggered." "Loss of regulation" not "dysregulated."

---

### Misuse: Individual Focus

**Pattern:** Staff focus only on individual children, not systems.

**Redirection:** Consider systems. "How can we improve the system?" not just "How can we fix this child?"

---

### Misuse: Therapeutic Overreach

**Pattern:** Staff try to provide therapy or therapeutic interventions.

**Redirection:** Support children in school contexts. Provide safety, predictability, and support. Refer to appropriate professionals for therapy.

---

### Misuse: Blame or Pathologise

**Pattern:** Staff blame children or pathologise behaviour.

**Redirection:** Understand behaviour as communication. Respond to need, not just behaviour. Consider context and systems.

## What This Module Does NOT Do

- Does NOT provide clinical expertise or training
- Does NOT teach therapeutic techniques
- Does NOT require personal disclosure or sharing
- Does NOT diagnose or assess trauma
- Does NOT provide behaviour management programmes
- Does NOT replace safeguarding training
- Does NOT promise specific outcomes

## Safeguarding & Boundary Note

This module introduces principles and language. It does NOT replace safeguarding training or procedures. If you have safeguarding concerns, follow your school's safeguarding procedures immediately. Trauma-informed practice supports safeguarding by helping staff recognise and respond to need, but it does NOT replace safeguarding protocols or professional responsibilities. Always follow safeguarding procedures first.
