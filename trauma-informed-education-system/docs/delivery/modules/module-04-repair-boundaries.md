## Safeguarding & Boundary Note

This module supports relationship repair and boundary maintenance. It does NOT replace safeguarding training or procedures.

Repair supports safeguarding by maintaining appropriate relationships and boundaries, but it does NOT replace safeguarding protocols or professional responsibilities. Always follow safeguarding procedures first.
