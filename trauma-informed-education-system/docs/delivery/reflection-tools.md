# Reflection Without Extraction

## Purpose

This document provides reflection tools that support learning without emotional labour extraction. Reflection should feel supportive and useful, not performative, surveilled, or therapeutic.

---

## Why Reflection Often Fails

### Becomes Performative

Reflection becomes performative when people feel they must reflect in certain ways to meet expectations. This creates compliance, not learning.

**Signs:** People reflect in ways they think are expected, not in ways that are useful. Reflection feels like a requirement, not a tool.

**Impact:** Reflection loses value. People go through motions without learning or changing.

---

### Becomes Surveillance

Reflection becomes surveillance when it's used to monitor, evaluate, or judge people. This creates fear and reduces honesty.

**Signs:** Reflection is collected, reviewed, or used for evaluation. People feel watched or judged.

**Impact:** Reflection loses safety. People avoid honesty or stop reflecting.

---

### Becomes Therapeutic

Reflection becomes therapeutic when it requires personal disclosure, emotional sharing, or trauma history. This creates risk and harm.

**Signs:** Reflection requires personal disclosure or emotional sharing. People feel pressured to share trauma or personal experiences.

**Impact:** Reflection creates harm. People feel exposed, vulnerable, or unsafe.

---

## Design Principles for Safe Reflection

### Optional

**Principle:** Reflection is always optional. People choose whether, when, and how to reflect.

**Why:** Mandatory reflection becomes performative or surveilled. Optional reflection supports learning.

**Implementation:** Reflection tools are available, not required. People can use them as needed, not on demand.

---

### Time-Bound

**Principle:** Reflection is time-bound. It has clear start and end points, not open-ended exploration.

**Why:** Time-bound reflection prevents therapeutic drift and emotional overload. It stays focused and useful.

**Implementation:** Reflection tools have time limits (2–5 minutes for individual, 10–15 minutes for team). They end when time ends.

---

### Non-Evaluative

**Principle:** Reflection is non-evaluative. It's not used to assess, judge, or evaluate people.

**Why:** Evaluative reflection becomes surveillance. Non-evaluative reflection supports learning.

**Implementation:** Reflection is not collected, reviewed, or used for evaluation. It's for personal or team learning only.

---

### No Personal Disclosure Required

**Principle:** Reflection never requires personal disclosure, trauma history, or emotional sharing.

**Why:** Personal disclosure creates risk and harm. Reflection can support learning without disclosure.

**Implementation:** Reflection prompts focus on practice, not personal experience. They use examples, scenarios, or professional contexts.

---

## Micro-Reflection Formats

### Individual Reflection (2–5 Minutes)

**Never evaluate:** Reflection should never be used to evaluate people or performance.

**Never require:** Reflection should never be required or mandatory.

## Inspection Safety

### What's Safe Under Inspection

**Safe:**
- "We use reflection tools to support learning"
- "Reflection is optional and non-evaluative"
- "Reflection focuses on practice, not personal experience"
- "Reflection supports continuous improvement"

**Why:** These statements are clear, professional, and appropriate. They don't create risk or harm.

---

### What's NOT Safe Under Inspection

**Not safe:**
- "We use reflection to assess staff"
- "Reflection is mandatory"
- "Reflection requires personal disclosure"
- "Reflection is therapeutic"

**Why:** These statements create risk, harm, or inappropriate expectations. They should be avoided.

## Signs Reflection Has Gone Wrong

### Emotional Spillover

---

### Pressure to Share

**Sign:** People feel pressured to share personally or emotionally.

**What to do:** Stop pressure immediately. Clarify boundaries. Review reflection prompts.

### Loss of Trust

**Sign:** People lose trust in reflection or stop reflecting honestly.

**What to do:** Rebuild trust. Review what went wrong. Restore safety.

**Prevention:** Keep reflection optional, non-evaluative, and safe.

---

### Performance Framing

**Sign:** Reflection feels like performance evaluation or assessment.

**What to do:** Stop evaluation immediately. Clarify purpose. Restore learning focus.
