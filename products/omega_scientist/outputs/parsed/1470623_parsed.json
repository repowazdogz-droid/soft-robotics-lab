This description of the developing field of soft robotics is not intended to be \na conventional review, in the sense of a comprehensive technical summary of the field. Rather, \nits objective is to describe soft robotics as a new field—one that offers opportunities to chemists \nand materials scientists who like to make “things,” and to work with macroscopic objects that \nmove and exert force. It will give one (personal) view of what soft actuators and robots are, and \nhow this class of soft devices fits into the more highly developed field of conventional “hard” \nrobotics. It will also suggest how and why soft robotics is more than simply a minor technical \n“tweak” on hard robotics, and propose a unique role for chemistry, and materials science, in this \nfield. Soft robotics is, at its core, intellectually and technologically different from hard robotics, \nboth because it has different objectives and uses, and because it relies on the properties of \nmaterials to assume many of the roles played by sensors, actuators, and controllers in hard \nrobotics. \n \nRobotics is at a stage of technological development perhaps comparable to the very early internet \n(plausibly at the level of the transistor or simple chips).  It’s when machines, humans (and \npossibly animals and insects) begin to work together and/or to compete, and even fuse, that \nthings change and get really interesting. Soft robotics will be an essential part of that change. \nChemistry and materials science should not miss the opportunity to be a part of it. \n \n \nRobotics and Jobs. Why is robotics an important field? The shortest and most immediate \nanswer is “jobs.” Robotics evolved to allow human- or animal-like functions to be carried out by \nmachines. The original idea was to observe the architecture of a human worker or a working \nanimal – body plan, skeleton, muscles, nerves – and mimic his/her/its useful functions, \naugmented with greater strength, speed, and accuracy, in a roughly human- or animal-shaped \nmachine. (The idea of substituting machines for animals was, of course, not new: a farm tractor \nis, in a sense, an ox with wheels instead of legs, and an airplane is a reconsidered bird.) \n \nThe field of robotics is, however, much more than just a new way of providing useful work (even \nwork that spares humans). It is a part of four very important subjects:  i) jobs (and the economic \ncapacity of nations), ii) non-human capabilities that come from biomorphic but inanimate forms, \niii) physical compatibility or incompatibility of robots with humans, and the prospects of \nmelding the two, and iv) the potential for (and perhaps inevitability of) fusing machines, humans, \nand artificial intelligence, and the consequences of that fusion.  \n \nThe first of these is one important contributor to the sense of urgency that permeates economic \nconsiderations of robotics today.[1]Much of the conflict between nations and regions, and much \nof their economic welfare, is reflected in their competition for jobs, and in their efforts to match \ntheir workforce to the number of jobs their societies require.[2] Existing robots – from those on \nmanufacturing assembly-lines, to driverless cars, autonomous drones, and semi-autonomous \nvacuum cleaners – constitute a remarkably rapidly developing set of machines that replace, \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \ncomplement, and/or augment human workers in many types of work.[3] Existing (hard) robots \nhave, however, important shortcomings (sketched in the following sections in greater detail). Soft \nrobots are important—more important than they might seem now, in their technological \ninfancy—because they will circumvent some of the shortcomings of hard robots, and will solve \nproblems hard robots cannot solve. Understanding the potential of this new field, and the \nopportunities that it is addressing, suggests some of the characteristics that successful soft robots \nwill eventually possess, and thus indicates some of the features that must be embedded in their \ndesigns. Because so much of the function of soft robots will depend upon materials (as opposed \nto—or in many cases rather than—electronics, sensors and controllers, and mechanical systems), \nunderstanding their possible applications defines the materials that they will need (in part), and \nthus the role of chemistry. \n \n \nAn indication of the size of the problem that robotics addresses is given by a phrase that appears \n– in one or another form – in a number of analyses of robots: that is, ” China’s future is Japan’s \nrobots.”[4] This startling statement is not, of course, literal, but it is based on demographic trends \nthat will be hard to change. The population in China (and Japan, and much of the Western world) \nis aging, and the number of younger people available to fill jobs, and thus to support this aging \npopulation, is less than it must be for stable economic growth to continue.[5] In this sense, \nrobotics is an essential part of China’s future economic growth.[6] The same remark can be made \nfor Japan, the United States, and Western Europe, where aging populations, and (often) negative \npopulation growth provide requirements for new strategies to use in operating industrialized \nsocieties. Robotics and intelligent machines is certainly one relevant new technology; \ncomputation and (AI) (whatever that becomes!) is another. A third might be changes in the \nsocieties themselves that make them more or less labor-intensive. Whether the robots that China \nuses are Japan’s, or are those of some other region or society (including, of course, China itself), \nis now an open question. Japan was an early leader in robotics[7], but the United States, China, \nand Europe are all now important, with different regions having different strengths in areas of \nfabrication, operation and use, information technology, integration with the Industrial Internet of \nThings (IIoT), and other aspects of this technology.  \n \nThe point of this discussion is not – obviously – to analyze regional demographic and economic \ntrends, but rather to make the case that robots and intelligent machines will be a critical part of \nthe future economic competence of countries and regions. I believe that soft robotics will provide \nimportant new capabilities for this broad area of technology. As a newcomer and a new \ntechnology, soft robots will not displace hard robots: soft robots will (at least initially) augment \nhard robots, supplement and extend them, and provide new capabilities that they cannot match. \nSoft robots (and, broadly, soft functional devices) are unusual in that they provide an exceptional \nopportunity for chemists and materials scientists to be a part of the core group founding a new \nfield.  \n \n \nHard Robots. Hard robots are fabricated, by definition, from rigid structural materials, and \npowered either using electrical actuators (motors and solenoids) or with pressurized fluids \n(pneumatically or hydraulically). Controlling the motion of hard robots is a very highly \ndeveloped and technologically sophisticated field. They are used both in tethered form (that is, \nfixed to the floor of an assembly line, as in automobile manufacturing) or as mobile entities (e.g., \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \nin moving goods in warehouses, in household appliances, and in military applications). In both \nmodes, they are more or less autonomous (e.g., capable of adapting to new tasks, and to changes \nin their environment, without human intervention and external control). They are often heavy, \nand inefficient in their use of energy. They are capable of amazingly complex motions, but at the \ncost of correspondingly complex motion-control systems.  \n \nRobots, Machines, and Actuators:  What Is the Difference? The boundaries between these \nterms are blurry. An actuator is a device that supplies energy (usually in the form of motion, or \nthe ability to do mechanical work) to another device. Electric motors, and pneumatic pistons, are \nactuators. A machine is a mechanical system – typically with multiple moving parts – that \nperforms one or multiple tasks. A robot is a machine that replicates (or mimics) some features of \n(originally) humans or animals, and is capable of replicating useful human-like tasks such as \nwalking or gripping (and, now, talking, and in the future, perhaps, understanding).  \n \nThe overlaps between these informal definitions is obvious. Less obvious is the extension of the \nidea of complex, “human-mimetic” robots to organisms that are anatomically and functionally \nless complicated—starfish, worms, other “simple” animals—than people and horses, but \nnonetheless capable of very complex motions, and useful (especially for the organism) functions. \nThese “simple” biological models have the potential to suggest useful new functions for robotics, \nand especially, since they are themselves soft, functions that might interact well with human \nneeds. Mimicking their functions is also less difficult than those of higher organisms: “gripping” \nis easier to accomplish than “understanding,” and even than “welding.”    \n \nSoft robots are much earlier in their technological development than hard ones. Most of the \ncurrent demonstrations of soft devices are in applications as actuators, or specialized functional \ncomponents of complex robots or machines (grippers, lifters). In practice, most soft robotic \nsystems are now used as components of hybrids integrating hard and soft components, and in \nwhich each component carries out the task for which it is best suited. In this perspective, we will \ntypically talk of “actuators” when trying to be precise about a task, and “robots” for greater \ngenerality. \n \nWhat is Missing in Hard Robots? Hard robotics is a hugely successful field, and robots are an \nindispensable component of many industrial functions. That said, hard robots—especially those \nintended for heavy industrial applications, have characteristics that can be severe limitations in \nother circumstances: \n \n \n“Collaboration.” The most important is that they are what is called “non-collaborative.” \nThey are often not able to work safely in close contact with (or proximity to) people, or other \nfragile objects. Because they are both heavy and hard, and are designed (in general) to move \nrapidly, to apply large forces, and to handle dangerous tools (e.g., tools for welding and cutting \nmetal), they are too dangerous to be close to humans.[8] One important contribution of soft robots \nis the ability to allow robots to work safely with people, and to handle soft objects. (For example, \nsoft grippers are attractive for handling food, or packages containing soft goods). \n \n \nSimplicity and Lower Cost. Hard robots – like all hard machines – are built largely of \nnoncompliant materials. As a result, they must be positioned accurately to perform their tasks, \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \nand they are generally not (nor are they designed to be) compliant, or able to adapt autonomously \nto different shapes and tasks. Soft robots, although much simpler in many ways, are much better \nadapted than hard robots for specific tasks in which the ability to conform autonomously to \ndifferent shapes is useful. Rather than a “hand” requiring accurate positioning, sensors, and \ncontrol loops for individual “fingers” (as in a hard robotic hand), soft robots can adapt to \ngripping and other tasks with minimal controls, by taking advantage of the compliance of the \nelastomeric materials from which they are made.[9] An important potential for soft robotics is to \nuse the properties of the soft, elastomeric materials (perhaps combined with thin structures with \nhigh tensile moduli such as fabric, paper, or film) in a structure (e.g., a soft “hand”) that might \nmake unnecessary the much more complex systems of electronic controllers, actuators, and \ncomputers used in a hard “hand.”. \n \nWith simplicity, of course, often comes lower cost, simpler operation, and greater durability.  \nFurther, since soft actuators are often fabricated from a single piece of flexible elastomer, and \nhave no frictional surfaces at joints or bearings, maintenance and wear can be less than with hard \nrobots. Although the relative cost of systems of hard and soft robotics competing for particular \napplications will depend upon the specifics of the application, there will be important \napplications for which soft robots are clearly more adaptable, better suited, and less expensive. \n \n \nOther Characteristics: Light Weight, Thermodynamic Efficiency. Soft actuators are \noften lighter in weight than their hard analogues. (There are, of course, designs that maximize the \nratio of strength-to-weight for both, but soft structures using pressurized thin walls can combine \nremarkably high stiffness with light weight.)  The thermodynamic efficiencies of most soft \nsystems has not been as carefully defined as have been those in hard ones, but hard robots are \nnot, generally, thermodynamically very efficient, and may thus have high energy costs. \n \nFor Robots of All Kinds: What will the future hold? The integration of human workers with \nincreasingly competent machines – whether hard or soft – seems inevitable. \nParticularly in \nthe countries of the economically developed world with aging populations and a high standard of \nliving, there are entire classes of jobs for which there are currently too few available human \nworkers. Fruit picking, mining, food handling and preparation, house cleaning, military and \npolice operations, eldercare, agricultural field work, garbage disposal, and a range of others: \nthese jobs are sometimes difficult, unpleasant, or dangerous, and it might be better to have them \ndone by machines than by people. Soft machines will be required, or preferred to people, for \nsome of them.  \n \nThe hope, of course, is that jobs that are transferred from humans to machines will allow the \nhumans to take on other, more rewarding jobs. What will they be? The answer to this question is \npresently unknown. It is not impossible to make such replacements beneficial for all involved. \nConsider previous replacements of humans and animals by machines. The horse-drawn cart, \nlocomotive, and automobile were all developed to replace the labor of humans or animals by \nmachines. Washing machines and dishwashers freed (largely) women from these tasks, and \nallowed them tobecome teachers, managers, musicians, bankers, and other skilled professionals. \nThe outcome of the redistribution of “work” among humans, animals, machines, and computers \nis impossible to predict in any detail now, but it is unquestionably one of the most important \nchanges now facing society. Soft robotics will play a part. \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \n \nWhat will be the result of fusion of robots, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine \nlearning?  How will humans be involved? The story of “future technology” is more \ncomplicated than just “humans,” “robots,” and the distribution of physical labor. There is also \nthe enormously important role of future computer systems (the World Wide Web, mobile \ndevices, artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, the Internet of Things (the IoT) and the \nIndustrial IoT (the IIoT), and many other manifestations of “intelligent machines”). There is – at \nleast in my opinion – a critical role for soft robots and actuators to act as intermediaries between \nhumans (who are intrinsically soft, but involved both in physical tasks, and in using \ninformation), robots (which are highly competent machines, albeit with increasing sophistication \nin information processing) and computer systems (which, arguably, already “think,” and are \nmoving—almost certainly—toward “understanding”). The form and function of these \nhuman/robotic/computer interactions, and of hybridized systems combining humans and \nmachines, is presently unpredictable (but include—as physical manifestations—exoskeletons, \nprostheses, manipulators at very large or very small scales, brain-controlled machines, and \nsensors that augment human perception). To the extent that they will involve \nphysical/mechanical contact between humans and machines, soft robotics and systems will be \nimportant. \n \nWhat does the subject of Soft Robotics have to do with Chemistry? A major component of \nsoft systems – from robotics to actuators—will be soft materials—elastomers, flexible sheets, \nfabrics, granules, foams, gels, liquid crystals, liquids, and other forms of matter. Reconfigurable \nsoft robots incorporating harder structural components—such as those designed using the \nprinciples of origami and kirigami[10] —will also be important. As the field develops, certain soft \nsystems will also require structurally rigid components (the equivalent of endo- and \nexoskeletons, intended to provide passive structural strength that soft materials may not \nintrinsically possess), but economics and materials compatibility will probably dictate that these \nmaterials are often also structural polymers rather than metals. Thus, soft robotics offers to \nmaterial science, and thus to chemistry, an enormous range of opportunities to generate new \ntypes of function. The syntheses of super-soft elastomeric bottlebrush polymers by Sheiko,[11] \nsuper-elastic polymers by Suo et al.,[12] and self-healing polymers and structures by Bao[13] and \nShepherd[14] are early examples. Soft Robotics is, and will probably remain, a technology \nfounded on soft, functional, materials, fabricated from molecular precursors, in polyfunctional \ndesigns.   \n \nBackground.  \n  \n \nHard Robotics is a mature field, and has been extensively reviewed.[15] We will not \ndiscuss it further. Soft Robotics has grown sufficiently rapidly that it is already described in \nmany excellent, technologically focused, reviews.[16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24] Rather than trying to \nreplicate or summarize them, we simply list them. We note only that (to paraphrase J.F. \nKennedy, and many others before him) “Victory has many fathers,” and claims in these early \nreviews of who developed what technology first, are still to be adjudicated by history. Two \nhistorical efforts were particularly relevant to our own work. First, a class of pneumatic actuators \nbased on mesh-constrained elastomeric bladders—a kind of semisoft actuator (McKibben \nActuators)—were developed and commercialized in the 1950s.[25]  These systems have been \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \nsuccessful, but were intended primarily to be linear actuators. Second, Suzumori demonstrated \nsimple, elastomer-based actuators in the 1980s.[26] These systems were, in fact, very similar to \nsome of the soft devices that have emerged in the current explosion of work in “soft robotics,” \nand Suzumori was perhaps the first to recognize a part of the potential for this kind of system.   \n \nMy personal (and therefore, limited) perspective is that the field of soft robotics has been able to \ngrow as rapidly as it has as a result of a confluence of six technologies developed independently \nfor other purposes. These include: i) Poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) elastomers as structural \nmaterials that make fabrication convenient (and thus enable rapid prototyping), and possesses a \nnumber of useful properties (transparency, ease of sterilization, biocompatibility, etc.). ii) Soft \nLithography and Microfluidics to form appropriate pneumatic and hydraulic channels. iii) \nDigital Fabrication, especially to aid in making molds. iv) Soft Composites, to generate and \ncontrol anisotropic motion on actuation. v) Computers, and Computer-based Systems, to serve \nfunctions from design and fabrication to control, and vi) Hard Robotics. Hard robotics are \nparticularly important, since they are highly developed, and provide a wide range of important \ncapabilities (from positioning and motion control to visualization) that are also important for soft \nrobotics, reliably and surprisingly affordably.  Together, this set of technologies combine to \nprovide: an elastomeric material with excellent properties, suitable both for prototyping and for \nproduction; fabrication methods taken from well-developed methodologies—soft lithography[27]  \nand PDMS microfluidics;[28] a convenient, flexible method of making the molds required to \nfabricate the networks of pneumatic channels required in most designs; straightforward methods \nof controlling the anisotropy of strain by forming composites of PDMS with flexible but \ninextensible sheets (or other composite designs), and origami/kirigami-based structures[29]; \ndesign, control, and vision tools based on computers; and concepts from hard robotics, and more \nimportantly, from existing, highly engineered hard robotic systems, for use in hard/soft hybrid \nsystems. Which of these technologies persist as important parts of the field of soft devices as it \ndevelops depends on the characteristics of the applications being addressed.  \n  \n \n  \n \nOur Starting Point in Soft Robotics. \n  \n \nThe Beginning: Biomimicry Based on Invertebrates and Higher (but Not Mammalian) \nOrganismic Models:  from Worms to Squid. The starting point for our work in this field was a \nseries of discussions (largely carried out in the 1980s and 90s in a very stimulating working \ngroup – the DSRC, or “Defense Science Research Council” – a group focused heavily on \nmaterials science, and sponsored by DARPA). The possibility of approaches to robotics that \nprovided capabilities beyond those of existing, largely industrial, hard robots was, of course, \nalready a subject of active discussion, and one subject of discussion was always “are there other \nways of doing it?” Most of robotics at that point was based on the idea of modeling humans or \nanimals, or making other mechanical systems (e.g., aircraft or vehicles) more versatile and \npolyfunctional, in order to give them greater capability or autonomy. \n  \nAmong our early interests in the subject of soft robots were the characteristics of animals lacking \ninternal skeletons. All have countless interesting anatomical functions. Worms, for example, \nmove with a sophistication that is still not easy to replicate; starfish provided the first models and \ninspirations for grippers. Squid and octopodes are inspiring examples of very intelligent animals \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \nusing complex motions controlled using strategies quite different from the ones land-animals \nuse. (For example, the tentacles of an octopus are at least partially controlled locally: each \ntentacle has its own complex set of local nerves as a controller.[30]) Insects do not have \nendoskeletons (or, generally, lungs), but they do have exoskeletons. These skeletons enable them \nto move efficiently without buoyant support from water, but they are limited in size by structural \nconstraints, and by restrictions, inter alia, in rates of mass transport of oxygen from air into their \ntissue.  Aspects of all of these functions are now visible in current soft actuators. \n \nDiscussions with DARPA program managers—originally Dr. Mitch Zakin, and later Dr. Gill \nPratt—led to an initial, multi-team project: the “Chemical Robots”, or “ChemBots” program.  \nThe objective of the program was to develop a soft system that would start by looking like a soft-\ndrink can, autonomously unfold, move across the floor, find a door and crawl under it, and \nreconfigure into a something that looked like a soft-drink can on the other side. The ChemBots \nprogram did not, in fact, produce a working example of technology having this level of \ncomplexity, but it provided a number of successful component technologies, and was the very \nsuccessful starting point for technical approaches to soft robotics. Probably as importantly, it \nnucleated the area, and provided initial support for a number of investigators—Rob Wood, \nDaniella Rus, Heinrich Jaeger, Peko Hosoi, Barry Trimmer, Mahadevan—and \nstudents/postdocs—Rob Shepherd, Carmen Majidi, Mike Tolley, Rebecca Kramer, Christoph \nKeplinger, and others—who have subsequently emerged as leaders of the field. \n \nAlthough pneumatic inflation emerged from this program as the most immediately useful method \nof actuation (and certainly the simplest to implement), a number of other interesting approaches \nalso emerged.  For example, Jaeger’s demonstration of pneumatics to accomplish granular \njamming in loose particles, and thus to freeze shapes[31] is particularly interesting for its \ncomplementarity to pneumatic methods that cause large, dynamic changes in shape in soft \nelastomers, and will probably become an important part of the technology of the field in the \nfuture.   \n \n \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

The \n“palm” of the gripper is hard, and attached to a commercial, hard, arm. (Soft Robotics, Inc.). \nBoth rely on PneuNets and pneumatic actuation.  \n \nPneuNets: Initial Work on Soft Actuators.  The initial work in my group was designed to \nprovide the simplest solution we could find to the problem of actuation (Figure 1a). It used the \nexpansion of a bladder (or balloon) constrained by its shape, and either by the anisotropic \nproperties of the elastomeric materials (e.g., combinations of more and less flexible PDMS)[32], \nor by the incorporation of paper- or cloth-based structures into elastomeric composites to control \nanisotropy of motion on actuation.[33] To control the stress, and the distribution of stress, in these \nsystems, we used a number of strategies.  It was often useful to fabricate a network of small \nbladders (rather than a single large one) connected to a common source of pressure to engineer \nthe distribution of strain, and thus shape, in the inflated soft device.  Digital printing made it easy \nto make the molds required to form these microchannel systems (which we called “pneumatic \nnetworks,” or PneuNets) in the PDMS.[34]  \n \n \n \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \nSealing techniques developed in PDMS microfluidics could be used directly with these \npneumatic systems; because we used pressures that were typically only 50 – 100 kPa (0.5 – 1 \natm) relative to ambient pressure, high-strength seals were not required for prototyping. Figure 2 \nillustrates the process used originally; the same principles are still used, albeit with different \ndesigns for the bladders, and different methods of fabrication.     \n \n \nFigure 2.  a-d.

All rights reserved \nThe fact that relatively low pressures are involved in these actuators can seem surprising, but it is \ngood to remember that net force scales with pressure and area (F = PA), and 1 atm of pressure \nover 20 in2 (or 130 cm2) is about 130 kg. Since actuation can result either from a positive or \nnegative difference in pressure (that is, from either “applied pressure” or “applied vacuum”) \nacross appropriately designed PneuNets, the same forces can be generated with both. With \nappropriate materials and designs, it should be possible in the future to go to much larger \npressures, and thus much higher applied forces (1 atm of pressure is ~ 1 kg-force cm2). \n  \nThese principles led quickly to a range of demonstrations of soft actuators with biomimetic \nfunctions.   \n \n \n“Starfish Gripper.” The first example of a useful soft device (published in Angew. \nChem.[32] over the objection of the referees, on the grounds that it was “not chemistry”) was a \npentagonal gripper (Figure 1; shown picking up an uncooked egg).  \n \n \nFigure 3.

Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. \n \nBecause grippers have proved so important practically, and because this class of actuator is \nrelatively easy to make, many variants on the structures of grippers have already appeared \n(Figure 3). Tentacles[35] have been designed and demonstrated in profusion, stimulated by the \nadmirable dexterity of the octopus.  (All of these demonstrations, and certainly including ours, \nfall far short of the capability of even the least capable cephalopods, and have essentially nothing \nto do with the anatomy, sensory system, and control with which they generate their extraordinary \nmotions.) Simple Walkers[36] proved easy to make, although not so far useful. They have, \nhowever, provided a useful test bed for the development of autonomous, mobile systems. \nExploring other possibilities led to a number of interesting, if odd, functions. For example a \n“Chameleon’s Tongue”[37] demonstrated the ability of a soft actuator to move surprisingly \nrapidly (complete coiling of a tentacle[34] requires less than 200 msec.), and “Combustion-driven \nJumpers” [38] demonstrated that it would be possible to generate substantial pressure on-board \n(by filling the PneuNet with a methane-air mixture, and then igniting it with a spark).[39] Other \nmethods of generating pressure internally – for example, the decomposition of hydrogen \nperoxide to oxygen and water[40]—have also been demonstrated, but have not so far proved \npractically useful. Perhaps (at least in the long term) a more interesting demonstration is that of \nthe use of the microfluidic function built into soft devices for functions other than motion. For \nexample, Fluidic Transport for Observation, Delivery, and Sampling[35b] can transport reagents \nto an object or a test sample, examine its environment, and retrieve fluids from a test site, with \nalmost no modification of the robot other than adding another small fluidic channel for transport \nof fluids. \n \nThe same type of microfluidic system provides the basis for a walker that capable of \nCamouflage[41] (reflecting exchange of fluids in microchannel systems in the PDMS structure); \nthis walker could show independent patterns in visible and IR spectral regions. (Camouflage has \nproved a subject of enduring interest in soft robotics, stimulated in part by the marvelous abilities \nof the octopus.) Non-Biological Functions. Similar uses of small channels in non-soft-robotic \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \napplications (e.g., microfluidics) had established the value of microchannels in fabricating \noptical waveguides and small dye lasers, flexible electrical conductors, and current carriers for \ngenerating magnetic fields using the same methods of fabrication[42]. Incorporation of a small \ncamera (taken from a cell phone) on the tip of a tentacle, coupled to a computer either using a \nfiber optic or Bluetooth link, gave these simple systems “eyes.”[35b, 36b]  \n \nTethered vs. Non-Tethered Systems: Power. Most of these demonstrations have involved \nactuation by compressed gas from an external source, and thus require a gas-transfer line \nconnecting the actuator to this source. Actuators that are connected to stationery, external power \nsources are called “tethered.” It is still an unresolved and still contentious issue as to whether \ntethering is an important limitation of these systems or not. In practice, many existing hard \nrobots—robots used on manufacturing lines, for example – are tethered. A smaller, but important \nset of robots—robots used for warehouse management, floor cleaning, and tasks requiring \nmovement over large areas (airborne drones, autonomous vehicles) – are, and must be, \nuntethered. Designing large, soft robots that are untethered and mobile, using PDMS and low \npressures, is difficult, simply because it is not straightforward for the body of a soft robot to \nsupport its own weight, plus the weight of the power supply, compressor, valves, and control \nrequired for complete autonomy[36b]. The question of how important this limitation is, is still \nbeing actively discussed, but if it is important, it almost certainly can be solved using stronger \nelastomers and higher pressures. In practice (see below), most current applications of soft \nactuators are in systems in which they are combined with hard robots; hard robots can operate \neither in tethered or untethered mode, and – if needed – provide power for soft robots. \n  \nBiomimetic Function, but Not Biomimetic Mechanism. An important point of emphasis is the \nmeaning of “biomimetic.” These PneuNet-based systems (and others) were designed to mimic \nthe function of biological systems: that is the ability to change shape, exert force, and do work. \nThey were not designed to mimic the mechanism by which organisms accomplish these \nfunctions (using muscle, or specialized structures such as hydrostats.) Although the literature is \nreplete with references to “artificial muscle,” none of these structures-- although interestingly \ndesigned, and possibly useful-- mimic any of the biochemistry—the ATP dependent interaction \nof myosin and actin fibers—that underlies the contraction of muscle (Figure 5).    \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nFigure 5.  (left) Human arm showing the biceps muscle, and (right) a PneuNet structure that \ncombines negative (sub-atmospheric) pressure and reversibly buckling elastomeric beams to \nmimic the function of this muscle[43].

PneuNets, actuated using positive and/or negative (sub-atmospheric) \npressures, have provided a starting point for providing power to soft devices, and have illustrated \nsome of the motions available to them. One of the features distinguishing soft and hard devices \nis, however, the nature of their response to actuation.  Hard robots are generally designed to be \nlinear in their response to their controllers. One of the interesting and differentiating features \nabout soft materials, is that—especially when operated with minimal controls—their response to \nactuation is often non-linear.  This characteristic is one basis for their adaptability, but can make \nthem more difficult to control than linear systems.  We consider non-linearity an advantage \n(although one requiring management) rather than a disadvantage, in that it allows the generation \nof very complex motions using very simple actuation (for example, Figure 6a).  One example of \na useful class of non-linear motions available in soft robotics is buckling. \n  \nBuckling and Other Non-Linearities of Materials.   \n \n \nFor most hard materials, buckling is a mechanism of failure. As one increases the \npressure on a concrete pillar, for example, its response (compressive strain) will be small, until it \nfails catastrophically. Soft beams also buckle (that is, at some pressure they show a large and \nnonlinear response), but this buckling is reversible, and hence a useful mechanism for actuation \nthat is not available in hard materials (Figures 5, 6).  \n \n \nFigure 6. Two structures illustrating “snap-through” (a useful form of non-linearity in soft \nstructures).  a.

A hollow, elastomeric beam that—when compressed—buckles and \ncrimps (thereby blocking the flow of air through the tube):  this structure can serve as a soft \nvalve \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \n \nBuckling, and nonlinear properties of materials, have been extensively studied. Our work in soft \nmaterials has relied both on empirical observation of prototypes of soft devices, and (heavily) on \nbeautiful studies by our colleagues Bertoldi[44], Suo[43], and Mahadevan[45].  Figures 5 and 6 \nprovide examples of the application of buckling in actuation.  The structure in Figures 5 \nparticularly interesting: this structure contracts linearly on application of vacuum, and this \nmotion results from the buckling of a series of internal elastomeric beams.[43, 46] It is—so far as \nwe know—the structure that comes closest to mimicking the behavior and functional \ncharacteristics (but certainly not the molecular mechanism) of biological muscle. \n \n \n \nPneumatic Origami Structures, and Structures with “Semi-soft” Components. Another \nbroadly useful class of structures are those in which the strength of soft materials is increased by \nadding flexible but non-elastic components.  Figure 7 shows two examples.  \n \nFigure 7. a. A PDMS tube, reinforced with a paper origami strain-limiting structure, lifts a heavy \nweight on pressurization. Reproduced from Ref. [33] with permission. Copyright 2012, John \nWiley & Sons. b. An arthrobot, in which the combination of flexible but non-elastic tubes \n(polyolefin drinking straws) and PDMS balloons (inside these tubes) provides a joint that mimics \nfunctional aspects of the joints of a spider. \n \nThe upper figure shows a “lifter” that has an origami structure of folded paper embedded in a \nthin, circular PDMS membrane.[33] This type of structure provides sufficient compressive \nstrength to lift a remarkably heavy weight (as a multiple of its own weight).  Extensions of this \nprinciple have recently demonstrated grippers with potentially useful strength.  Figure 7 also \nshows what we call an “arthrobot.”[47] This walking structure is loosely modeled on arthropods, \nwhich have hard (chitin, for ants) or semi-hard (for spiders) exoskeletons. This particular \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \nstructure has six legs (as does an ant) but joints whose mechanism of action is modeled on those \nof a spider (whose joints are, surprisingly—for such a complicated organism—among some of \nthe simpler joints found in arthropods). The structural strength is provided by circular tubes \n(polypropylene drinking straws, chosen for their availability, light weight, high strength, and low \ncost).   \n \nThe Materials Science of Soft Robots. Most of the initial work in soft robotics has been devoted \nto demonstrating elementary designs: of these, PneuNets,[34] and analogs of them, have so far \nproved the most broadly useful. For most of this work, commercial elastomers (especially \nPDMS, with occasional applications of elastomeric polyurethanes) have been the materials of \nchoice. PDMS has been especially useful because its properties are “good enough” (and perhaps \nin some cases optimally good) for both academic prototypes and initial commercial products, and \nbecause it is particularly easy to mold and seal. Silicone elastomers also come in a very wide \nrange of structures and properties; the family of siloxanes has the versatility required to solve \nmany problems in soft materials science. The fabrication of PneuNets has also benefited from the \nfact that much of the technology needed for academic demonstrations of soft robotics has been \nable to exploit (often without modification) fabrication methods developed for PDMS-based \nmicrofluidic systems. Further, composite structures—structures fabricated with heterogeneous \nstructures—typically incorporating elastomers with different mechanical properties and with \nflexible but inextensible sheet materials (paper, glass fiber, mesh, cloth)—have proved an \nintegral part of soft robotics (Figure 8).  \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

All rights reserved \n \n \nElastomeric composites are much less extensively explored than composites of hard materials \n(where they are, of course, at the heart of the design of materials-based structures).  It is routine \nto embed flexible sheets into PDMS structures to limit and direct their strain under the stress of \ninflation. By using origami or kirigami sheets, fibers, or flexible beams, a wide range of \ninteresting and useful behaviors can be achieved with minimal changes in methods of \nfabrication. \n  \nAlthough composite structures are central to materials science, soft-matter composites are \nrelatively unexplored, and the broader opportunity for introduction of new types of soft, \ncomposite materials into soft robotics is enormous. Chemistry has produced a very wide range of \nelastomeric materials, ranging from very soft gels to very tough particle- and fiber-reinforced \nrubbers (e.g., for tires). Very little of this range has yet to be explored as materials of \nconstruction for soft, “ultra-soft” or “hard-soft” robotics. Design and preparation of elastomeric \nmaterials with useful electromagnetic and optical properties is also just beginning. Biomedical \napplications will require careful engineering of mechanics, surfaces, biocompatibility, and gas-\ntransport properties.  \n \n \nThe Material as the Controller: “Intelligent Materials.” A concept that has emerged \nfrom initial work in soft robotics—one that differentiates it from hard robots—is that of “the \nmaterial as the controller.” Hard robots are almost entirely dependent upon systems of sensors \nand active controllers: for example, for a gripper, pressure sensors in the “fingers” sense pressure \nor force on the object being gripped, and use that information to compute appropriate forces \nsupplied, often by electrical motors, to provide adequate—but not damaging—gripping.[9] Much \nof this complexity can be eliminated with soft robots, albeit at the cost of reduced multi-finger \ndexterity.  Because soft fingers are compliant, they can, however, adapt to complex surfaces \nautonomously, and distribute pressure in a way that limits damage to the object being gripped \n(Figure 1).  Allowing the material (and the design) to control the pressure exerted by the gripper \nalso allows much simplified control (in fact, in some applications, control limited to the applied \npneumatic pressure), and safe manipulation of complex and fragile objects.  \n \n \nEngineering Properties. Establishing the properties of engineered materials—and the \nrequired materials databases—required to develop commercial products is an arduous process in \nwhich useful information accumulates with increasing volumes of application. Although relevant \ndevelopment research is just beginning, there are a range of indicators-- both from current work, \nand from accumulated experience using elastomers in other applications-- to guide expectations. \nCycle Lifetimes. How many times can an actuator bend before it begins to fail? Simple bending \ntests with PDMS fingers and tentacles suggest that millions of cycles are possible with only \nsmall changes in stress-strain relationships.[34, 46a] Damage Resistance. PDMS-based structures \nare remarkably resistant to damage on blunt impact. For example, because they are so light, it is \nalmost impossible to damage them by dropping, and it is possible to drive an automobile over a \nwalker without damage. Elastomers can also be astonishingly tough: fiber- and particle-\nreinforced truck tires are among the most durable of human-engineered structures. By contrast, \nPDMS and soft hydrogels fracture easily when cut (especially under tension). New types of very \ntough gels—typically inter-penetrating polymer networks—are, however, now appearing.[12, 50]  \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \n \nRelatively little detailed information relevant to the engineering of properties relevant to specific \napplications in soft systems is yet available. Comparisons between hard and soft systems may be \ndifficult, since their properties are so different. “Wear” Is an example that suggests the \ndifficulties of making comparisons.  When a soft “finger” or tentacle bends, stress is stored as \nstrain (reflecting changes in the conformation of the constituent polymer chains). Strain-induced \nchanges in the elastomer may result in accelerated aging, and thus in changes in bending \nmodulus. By contrast, when a hard “finger” bends, sliding friction between hard surfaces in \njoints or bearings can cause frictional wear, and perhaps require lubrication and cleaning. Correct \ncomparison of hard and soft systems is thus, in practice, difficult, since their motions are so \ndifferent. Other Properties.  A wide variety of other properties are relevant to specific uses of \nsoft robots and actuators: surface textures for grippers, ease of sterilization, resistance to \ntemperature or chemical corrosion, permeability, weight, optical and electromagnetic properties, \nbiocompatibility, cost, and many others must be considered on a case-by-case basis. It is, \nhowever, clear that in some applications—handling food, tissue, and humans, picking up soft \nobjects of irregular shapes, fitting into small or irregular spaces, operation in the presence of \ncorrosive agents, and others—soft systems may be successful in applications that would be very \ndifficult for hard systems. \n \n  \nNew Directions \n \n \nNew Actuators. Most of the work in soft robotics has used a limited set of elastomers as \nmaterials, and pressurized air, or vacuum, for power. There is certainly interest in alternatives, \nparticularly those that would use electricity.  Some of this interest is probably more based on \nfamiliarity, and the technological maturity of electrically- and combustion-actuated systems \n(electrical and IC motors, batteries, electrically controlled solenoids and valves), than on a \ncareful comparison of the characteristics and applications of hard and soft robots. Suo[51], \nKeplinger[52], Bauer[53] and others have demonstrated effective methods of electrical actuation \nrelevant to soft robotics using dielectric elastomers, and others will certainly be examined, but \nstrict electromagnetic analogs of hard robots have been slow to develop.  Perhaps more \nimportantly, an electrically-driven soft robot may simply not be as useful as a soft, \npneumatically-driven, adaptive one in broad classes of applications.  Efforts to use chemistry \n(either in terms of molecules with high free energy, such as H2O2, or by combustion) have not, so \nfar, proved practically useful in powering soft robots, although they work to a limited extent.[38-\n40, 54] Fuel cells compatible with soft structures provide an obvious, and largely unexplored \napproach to hybrids combining chemical fuels and electrical actuators/controllers, but would \nrequire hard components. Soft supercapacitors might also be useful. Other types of actuations—\nfor example, strain release in tightly wound, pre-stressed fibers (a concept developed by \nBaughman[55]) may also be interesting for some specific applications. That said, pneumatic \nactuation has proved so simple to implement in prototypes that no better method has yet \nemerged, and the problem of providing (or at least testing) a broader range of options for \nactivation of soft machines represents a largely-unexplored opportunity.  \n \n  \n \nNew Materials: Elastomers, Composites, Gels, Foams, Particles. The exploration of the \nchemistry and physics of soft matter—in the specific context of actuators and robots—is in its \ninfancy. A few elastomers have been surveyed, but only siloxanes have been seriously \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \ndeveloped. Liquid-crystal polymers, fiber- or particle-modified elastomers, elastomeric systems \ndesigned for high-pressure actuation, ultra-soft elastomers, very tough, stiff elastomers, and a \nwide variety of hybrid soft-hard systems are all potentially interesting. In addition, states of \nmatter such as very soft gels, foams, fibers, particle beds, fabrics, granular matter, and others are \nall, in principle, useful in actuators. In one relevant example, Jaeger and colleagues have \ndemonstrated remarkable characteristics for vacuum-jammed structures as grippers that are quite \ndifferent from grippers based on PneuNets.[31, 56] \n \n \nComponents and Soft Controllers.  Pneumatically-actuated soft robotics is limited by the \navailability of the obvious, standard components used to handle compressed gasses as soft \nstructures. The most commonly used types of valves are conventional hard solenoid valves, \nlocated (usually) close to the source of gas rather than on the robot; easily integrated equivalents \nof the “Quake valves”[57] (so useful in microfluidics) do not yet exist (although initial steps are \nevident[58]), nor are there reliable functional analogs of the set of components (transistors, \nresistors, capacitors, and inductors) that form the elements of electrical circuits, and that might—\nin principle—form the basis for “all-soft” controllers.   \n \n \nMultiplexed Fluidic Systems with Optical and Magnetic Functions.[42, 59] Two areas to \nwhich soft materials have been applied that are similar to soft robotics in some ways, and in \nprinciple easily integrated with it, are microfluidics and optics. Initial demonstrations into other \nareas suggest much broader application.  For example, we, Dickey, and others have \ndemonstrated PDMS systems that also act, in conjunction with liquid metals (for example, the \neutectic alloy of gallium and Indium, or EGaIn) as metallic electrical current conductors[60], or \n(with ionic liquids or gels) as transmitters of electrical potential[61]. There are initial \ndemonstrations of microchannel systems as optical waveguides[49] and dye lasers[62], as magnetic \nfield generators[42], in channel systems for transport of fluids, for sampling[63], and for delivery of \nmaterials as liquids or suspensions.[64] The integration of sensing, and delivery and analysis of \nchemicals, will probably be easier with soft components than with hard ones. The potential for \nsoft structures to be integrated with many biomedical applications—applications in which the \nrobotics structure must interact intimately with humans (human patients, human tissue, care \nproviders)—is large.  \n  \n \nAutonomous Systems. For soft systems to reach their full potential, it will probably \nultimately be necessary to develop them to the point where they can be autonomous (that is, \ncapable of independent adaption to task and environment, and perhaps to mobile and untethered \noperation, with little or no human intervention or control). Applications undersea (which are \nbeing explored by Wood and Rus)[65] are an obvious area in which autonomy would be useful, \nand in which soft robotics seems a natural fit since polymers have roughly the same neutral \ndensity as water, and mobile systems will not require structural strength to support their own \nweight. Maintaining neutral buoyancy becomes an issue for such systems, and probably favors \nthe use of hydraulic, rather than pneumatic, actuation).  \n \nDemonstrations of untethered systems using PDMS “walkers” have outlined some of the \nproblems that must be solved to make autonomy practical on land (Figure 4b).[36b] A useful \nquestion to answer in considering mobility in untethered, soft robots is: “why do octopodes not \nrun on land?” One answer is that they are adapted for the ocean, but a more technical answer is \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \nthat they are not designed structurally to support their own weight easily in a gravitational field, \nin the absence of the buoyancy provided by water. Soft robots would not necessarily suffer from \nthe same limitation as octopoids, since, in principle, the use of stiffer elastomers, and higher \npressures, would allow support of much heavier robotic structures. Also, as with insects, the use \nof stiff or semi-soft endo- or exo-skeletons would greatly increase the strength of soft robotic \nstructures, albeit at the expense of susceptibility to damage and of possible limitations to \nflexibility. None of these options has been developed for autonomous systems on land.  \n \n \nThe potential for soft robotics in certain kinds of applications in the air has also already \nbeen demonstrated. The most ingenious involve making structures that are essentially helium-\nfilled balloons with built-in capability to move in complex ways (Figure 9).  \n  \nFigure 9. Light-weight structures (essentially, structured helium-filled balloons). (left) A \ncommercial children’s toy (an “air swimmer”), and (right) a long, steerable arm (a Giacometti \nArm with a 20-m balloon body). Suzumori Endo Lab, Tokyo Institute of Technology[66]  \n \nThese systems do not, at present, have great strength, but large gas balloons (dirigibles) with \ngood strength are highly developed, and the simplicity and ingenuity of design of these new \nsystems suggests applications where high speed, limited environmental range (e.g., operations in \nstill air) and resistance to damage are not important. \n \n \nThermodynamic Efficiency; Systems for Temporary Storage of Energy in Strained \nMaterials. There is still relatively little experimental information on the thermodynamic \nefficiency of existing classes of soft robots.[38, 67] The few exceptions (measured using simple \nprocedures:  for example, a comparison of pressure-volume work with the work of lifting a \nweight) suggest un-optimized efficiencies of ~ 30%. One of the potential advantages and \nopportunities offered by soft robots is, however, the ability to store and recover energy from \nstrained elastomers. The leg tendons of kangaroos provide an example from Nature of the value \nof this kind of “spring-like” (and, in principle, recoverable) energy stored in strained structures. \n \n \nBiomedical Uses. A major reason for interest in soft robotics is their collaborativity—that \nis, ability to interact safely with humans.  Given that characteristic, one of the most obvious \npotentials for applications lies in medicine (broadly defined to include eldercare, treatment and \nprevention of pressure ulcers, prostheses of many types, catheters, surgical aids, aids in \nrehabilitation, assistive devices for nurses and hospital workers, technology for emergency \nresponse, and many others) or in biological research (e.g., handling laboratory animals, organs, \nand tissue samples).  These areas of research are only now beginning to develop, at least in part, \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \nbecause many of the problems to be solved in these applications are not per se robotic, but \nbiological, clinical, economic, or regulatory.  Biocompatibility is still a field in its infancy; any \nexperimentation on animals or humans is cloaked with regulations; the needs in most areas of \nmedicine (and certainly of nursing practice or eldercare) are unknown to materials scientists; \nresearch on “devices” is unpopular with government funding agencies. Initial experiments by \nWalsh in rehabilitation and soft components in exoskeletons[9, 68] do, however, demonstrate the \ninterest of the field (Figure 10 gives an example).  \n \nFigure 10. A grip-assist device, comprising a glove with pneumatically actuated elastomeric \n“fingers” that augment the grip of human fingers, or replace it. Reproduced from Ref. [68] with \npermission. Copyright 2013, IEEE Proceedings.  \n \nToward large-Scale Reality \n \n \nInitial Steps toward Commercial Technology (“Technology Transition”). Because \nthe technology of soft robotics and actuators is intrinsically simple (although—as with all new \ntechnology—operationally sophisticated in fabrication and use), the movement of this area \ntoward reality has been able to proceed rapidly. Our first paper—an academic demonstration—in \nthis subject (the “starfish gripper”) was published in 2011[32]. There are now (only seven years \nlater) a number of startup and established companies (Soft Robotics, Right Hand, Empire \nRobotics, Festo, OtherLab/Roam, SuperRelease Robotics, Rethink Robotics, Disney Research, \nand others) have started programs in the area, and demonstrated opportunities and shortcomings \nin specific approaches to technology and market development. Most initial applications have \ninvolved integration of soft or semi-soft grippers with already-commercial hard robotic arms, \ncontrollers, and vision systems to address applications in areas such as food handling, \neCommerce, and warehouse management. \n \n \nWhat Limits the Transition of This Technology into Commercial Applications? The \nlimiting factors now are probably less technological than matters of business: the most important \nis the availability of capital for applications research, product development, and manufacturing, \nfor understanding the relationships between fabricators of existing, commoditized, hard robotic \nsystems and these new (and perhaps complementary) soft technologies, and for developing \neconomically successful businesses depending on soft robotics. Because the technology is new, \nthere is also—inevitably—a first-developer and first-user premium for initial products. (The \ndeveloper of any new technology assumes the risks of unanticipated technical problems, and in \nidentifying and developing markets, and the users of the technology assume the risk of deploying \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

These types of issues make the \nfirst stages of commercializing soft robotics (as with all new technologies) challenging and \nintensely interesting. Comfortingly, the first generation of technology has already worked well in \nthe hand of users. The problems that need to be solved now are problems in finance, market \ndevelopment, business model, and business operations. \n \n \nThe Role of Chemistry and Materials Science in Soft Robotics.  \n \nExpansion of the capabilities of soft robotics requires new functional materials; the central \nmission of materials science is function. Materials science, in turn, is based on chemistry. Soft \nrobotics, therefore, offers many opportunities to chemists interested in functional materials. \nStructures able to exert very high force, biocompatible structures, materials and structures with \nbuilt-in sensing and control functions, structures resistant to damage in environments in which \nelectronics and conventional hard materials would fail (e.g., those with high radiation, \ntemperature, and corrosion) are all obvious candidates. Materials that store and release energy \nefficiently during stress/strain cycles, materials with long-term, non-irritating contact with skin \n(as in prostheses) or internal tissues (as in surgical repair and reconstruction) are more \ncomplicated because they involve living organisms, but the successes of PDMS in cosmetic \nsurgery are a good omen for future work.  Materials that would autonomously transduce \ninformation (e.g., from strain to electrical potential, or from electrical potential to Young’s \nmodulus) would add new capabilities.  \n \nBiology also has an outsized role to play in the future of the field, both in terms of applications in \nbiomedicine, and by providing countless examples of functional, soft structures on which to base \nnew classes of robotic systems[69]. To take one example—feet—animals and insects use an \nenormous number of strategies to allow movement across surfaces[70] ranging from liquid water \nto ceilings; these strategies are normally based on the properties of soft biological structures. The \nlist of interesting biological structures (feathers, scales, bone, blood vessels, eyes, muscles, \nnerves, tentacles, fluidic pumps and processors, and so on) is virtually endless, and almost none \nof these structures, or the functions that they generate, can presently be mimicked or replicated. \n \nAlthough this area is a rich one for discovery and invention, it will require—for many \nchemists—an unfamiliar step: that is, moving from a sharp focus on molecular synthesis and \nstructure, to a broader interest the design and preparation of materials with valuable functions, \nfabricated in forms and with economics that allow it to be useful. Taking that step opens many \nnew opportunities, but it also requires collaborations with non-chemists, and learning significant \nparts of new fields. \n \n \nSignificance \n \n \nSoft Robotics is a Vital Part of a Very Big New Thing: Robotics. Chemistry has \ndeveloped as a field that—through extraordinary technical skill—was uniquely able to design \nand make new molecules. Capabilities in synthesis were critical for commodity chemistry, and \nfor certain classes of specialty chemicals (explosives, dyes, adhesives, others) since the \nmolecular entity—the chemical—is the product in these areas.  For programs and products \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \noutside of commodities (e.g., pharmaceuticals, electronic materials, and agricultural chemicals) \nthe real difficulties in developing concepts or products often begin after the molecular synthesis \nis complete.  Synthesis is, for example, important in developing a successful drug, but the most \ndifficult and challenging parts of drug development are not the complexities of multistep \nsynthesis, but those in proving safety and efficacy, in running clinical trials, in interacting with \nthe FDA, and in a myriad of other activities. \n \nWhere does soft robotics fit into chemistry, and how important is molecular design, as opposed \nto screening and development of existing organic materials? What, to me, is important, is that \nrobotics is the basis of a technological shift in society, and that soft robotics will become a part \nof this shift (how important a part, only time will tell) with a very large component of materials \nand molecular design. Chemistry thus has an opportunity to play a major role in its development, \nthrough the invention, synthesis, and deployment of new functional chemicals, materials, and \nmethods of fabrication. New, soft materials will also lead to new opportunities, although where \nis not yet clear.  As an example, however: the exciting area of wearable electronics fits naturally \ninto soft composite structures for soft robotics[71], and including electronically functional fabrics \ninto elastomeric devices will allow the integration of sophisticated sensing, information \nprocessing, and motion, and integration of soft robotics and human healthcare requires \ndevelopment of technologies from biocompatibility and safety to ease of use in vivo, and from \nin-vivo sensing to non-contact communication and control.    \n \nFurther, robotics, combined with artificial intelligence, is becoming a technology with the \ncapability of generating “intelligent machines” that can compete with (or complement) humans \nfor jobs and work (a so-called “peer competitor”). Soft robotics brings the “collaboration” \nnecessary for smooth integration of biological, physical, and informatics systems.  Robotics will \nspan from bits and bytes to force and work, from simple generation of mechanical work to \ndevelopment of “machine intelligence,” and from entirely non-human machines to fully \nhumanoid systems (and to systems integrating humans and machines).  Much of what happens \nwill depend upon new functional materials. \n \nChemists have an opportunity to participate fully in the development of these materials, this \nfield, and the world that robotics will create. \n \n \n \n  \nAcknowledgments.

All rights reserved \n \nSoft Robotics \nGeorge M. Whitesides \nDepartment of Chemistry and Chemical Biology \nHarvard University, Cambridge MA, USA \n \n \nObjectives. This description of the developing field of soft robotics is not intended to be \na conventional review, in the sense of a comprehensive technical summary of the field. Rather, \nits objective is to describe soft robotics as a new field—one that offers opportunities to chemists \nand materials scientists who like to make “things,” and to work with macroscopic objects that \nmove and exert force. It will give one (personal) view of what soft actuators and robots are, and \nhow this class of soft devices fits into the more highly developed field of conventional “hard” \nrobotics. It will also suggest how and why soft robotics is more than simply a minor technical \n“tweak” on hard robotics, and propose a unique role for chemistry, and materials science, in this \nfield. Soft robotics is, at its core, intellectually and technologically different from hard robotics, \nboth because it has different objectives and uses, and because it relies on the properties of \nmaterials to assume many of the roles played by sensors, actuators, and controllers in hard \nrobotics. \n \nRobotics is at a stage of technological development perhaps comparable to the very early internet \n(plausibly at the level of the transistor or simple chips).  It’s when machines, humans (and \npossibly animals and insects) begin to work together and/or to compete, and even fuse, that \nthings change and get really interesting. Soft robotics will be an essential part of that change. \nChemistry and materials science should not miss the opportunity to be a part of it. \n \n \nRobotics and Jobs. Why is robotics an important field? The shortest and most immediate \nanswer is “jobs.” Robotics evolved to allow human- or animal-like functions to be carried out by \nmachines. The original idea was to observe the architecture of a human worker or a working \nanimal – body plan, skeleton, muscles, nerves – and mimic his/her/its useful functions, \naugmented with greater strength, speed, and accuracy, in a roughly human- or animal-shaped \nmachine. (The idea of substituting machines for animals was, of course, not new: a farm tractor \nis, in a sense, an ox with wheels instead of legs, and an airplane is a reconsidered bird.) \n \nThe field of robotics is, however, much more than just a new way of providing useful work (even \nwork that spares humans). It is a part of four very important subjects:  i) jobs (and the economic \ncapacity of nations), ii) non-human capabilities that come from biomorphic but inanimate forms, \niii) physical compatibility or incompatibility of robots with humans, and the prospects of \nmelding the two, and iv) the potential for (and perhaps inevitability of) fusing machines, humans, \nand artificial intelligence, and the consequences of that fusion.  \n \nThe first of these is one important contributor to the sense of urgency that permeates economic \nconsiderations of robotics today.[1]Much of the conflict between nations and regions, and much \nof their economic welfare, is reflected in their competition for jobs, and in their efforts to match \ntheir workforce to the number of jobs their societies require.[2] Existing robots – from those on \nmanufacturing assembly-lines, to driverless cars, autonomous drones, and semi-autonomous \nvacuum cleaners – constitute a remarkably rapidly developing set of machines that replace, \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \ncomplement, and/or augment human workers in many types of work.[3] Existing (hard) robots \nhave, however, important shortcomings (sketched in the following sections in greater detail). Soft \nrobots are important—more important than they might seem now, in their technological \ninfancy—because they will circumvent some of the shortcomings of hard robots, and will solve \nproblems hard robots cannot solve. Understanding the potential of this new field, and the \nopportunities that it is addressing, suggests some of the characteristics that successful soft robots \nwill eventually possess, and thus indicates some of the features that must be embedded in their \ndesigns. Because so much of the function of soft robots will depend upon materials (as opposed \nto—or in many cases rather than—electronics, sensors and controllers, and mechanical systems), \nunderstanding their possible applications defines the materials that they will need (in part), and \nthus the role of chemistry. \n \n \nAn indication of the size of the problem that robotics addresses is given by a phrase that appears \n– in one or another form – in a number of analyses of robots: that is, ” China’s future is Japan’s \nrobots.”[4] This startling statement is not, of course, literal, but it is based on demographic trends \nthat will be hard to change. The population in China (and Japan, and much of the Western world) \nis aging, and the number of younger people available to fill jobs, and thus to support this aging \npopulation, is less than it must be for stable economic growth to continue.[5] In this sense, \nrobotics is an essential part of China’s future economic growth.[6] The same remark can be made \nfor Japan, the United States, and Western Europe, where aging populations, and (often) negative \npopulation growth provide requirements for new strategies to use in operating industrialized \nsocieties. Robotics and intelligent machines is certainly one relevant new technology; \ncomputation and (AI) (whatever that becomes!) is another. A third might be changes in the \nsocieties themselves that make them more or less labor-intensive. Whether the robots that China \nuses are Japan’s, or are those of some other region or society (including, of course, China itself), \nis now an open question. Japan was an early leader in robotics[7], but the United States, China, \nand Europe are all now important, with different regions having different strengths in areas of \nfabrication, operation and use, information technology, integration with the Industrial Internet of \nThings (IIoT), and other aspects of this technology.  \n \nThe point of this discussion is not – obviously – to analyze regional demographic and economic \ntrends, but rather to make the case that robots and intelligent machines will be a critical part of \nthe future economic competence of countries and regions. I believe that soft robotics will provide \nimportant new capabilities for this broad area of technology. As a newcomer and a new \ntechnology, soft robots will not displace hard robots: soft robots will (at least initially) augment \nhard robots, supplement and extend them, and provide new capabilities that they cannot match. \nSoft robots (and, broadly, soft functional devices) are unusual in that they provide an exceptional \nopportunity for chemists and materials scientists to be a part of the core group founding a new \nfield.  \n \n \nHard Robots. Hard robots are fabricated, by definition, from rigid structural materials, and \npowered either using electrical actuators (motors and solenoids) or with pressurized fluids \n(pneumatically or hydraulically). Controlling the motion of hard robots is a very highly \ndeveloped and technologically sophisticated field. They are used both in tethered form (that is, \nfixed to the floor of an assembly line, as in automobile manufacturing) or as mobile entities (e.g., \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \nin moving goods in warehouses, in household appliances, and in military applications). In both \nmodes, they are more or less autonomous (e.g., capable of adapting to new tasks, and to changes \nin their environment, without human intervention and external control). They are often heavy, \nand inefficient in their use of energy. They are capable of amazingly complex motions, but at the \ncost of correspondingly complex motion-control systems.  \n \nRobots, Machines, and Actuators:  What Is the Difference? The boundaries between these \nterms are blurry. An actuator is a device that supplies energy (usually in the form of motion, or \nthe ability to do mechanical work) to another device. Electric motors, and pneumatic pistons, are \nactuators. A machine is a mechanical system – typically with multiple moving parts – that \nperforms one or multiple tasks. A robot is a machine that replicates (or mimics) some features of \n(originally) humans or animals, and is capable of replicating useful human-like tasks such as \nwalking or gripping (and, now, talking, and in the future, perhaps, understanding).  \n \nThe overlaps between these informal definitions is obvious. Less obvious is the extension of the \nidea of complex, “human-mimetic” robots to organisms that are anatomically and functionally \nless complicated—starfish, worms, other “simple” animals—than people and horses, but \nnonetheless capable of very complex motions, and useful (especially for the organism) functions. \nThese “simple” biological models have the potential to suggest useful new functions for robotics, \nand especially, since they are themselves soft, functions that might interact well with human \nneeds. Mimicking their functions is also less difficult than those of higher organisms: “gripping” \nis easier to accomplish than “understanding,” and even than “welding.”    \n \nSoft robots are much earlier in their technological development than hard ones. Most of the \ncurrent demonstrations of soft devices are in applications as actuators, or specialized functional \ncomponents of complex robots or machines (grippers, lifters). In practice, most soft robotic \nsystems are now used as components of hybrids integrating hard and soft components, and in \nwhich each component carries out the task for which it is best suited. In this perspective, we will \ntypically talk of “actuators” when trying to be precise about a task, and “robots” for greater \ngenerality. \n \nWhat is Missing in Hard Robots? Hard robotics is a hugely successful field, and robots are an \nindispensable component of many industrial functions. That said, hard robots—especially those \nintended for heavy industrial applications, have characteristics that can be severe limitations in \nother circumstances: \n \n \n“Collaboration.” The most important is that they are what is called “non-collaborative.” \nThey are often not able to work safely in close contact with (or proximity to) people, or other \nfragile objects. Because they are both heavy and hard, and are designed (in general) to move \nrapidly, to apply large forces, and to handle dangerous tools (e.g., tools for welding and cutting \nmetal), they are too dangerous to be close to humans.[8] One important contribution of soft robots \nis the ability to allow robots to work safely with people, and to handle soft objects. (For example, \nsoft grippers are attractive for handling food, or packages containing soft goods). \n \n \nSimplicity and Lower Cost. Hard robots – like all hard machines – are built largely of \nnoncompliant materials. As a result, they must be positioned accurately to perform their tasks, \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \nand they are generally not (nor are they designed to be) compliant, or able to adapt autonomously \nto different shapes and tasks. Soft robots, although much simpler in many ways, are much better \nadapted than hard robots for specific tasks in which the ability to conform autonomously to \ndifferent shapes is useful. Rather than a “hand” requiring accurate positioning, sensors, and \ncontrol loops for individual “fingers” (as in a hard robotic hand), soft robots can adapt to \ngripping and other tasks with minimal controls, by taking advantage of the compliance of the \nelastomeric materials from which they are made.[9] An important potential for soft robotics is to \nuse the properties of the soft, elastomeric materials (perhaps combined with thin structures with \nhigh tensile moduli such as fabric, paper, or film) in a structure (e.g., a soft “hand”) that might \nmake unnecessary the much more complex systems of electronic controllers, actuators, and \ncomputers used in a hard “hand.”. \n \nWith simplicity, of course, often comes lower cost, simpler operation, and greater durability.  \nFurther, since soft actuators are often fabricated from a single piece of flexible elastomer, and \nhave no frictional surfaces at joints or bearings, maintenance and wear can be less than with hard \nrobots. Although the relative cost of systems of hard and soft robotics competing for particular \napplications will depend upon the specifics of the application, there will be important \napplications for which soft robots are clearly more adaptable, better suited, and less expensive. \n \n \nOther Characteristics: Light Weight, Thermodynamic Efficiency. Soft actuators are \noften lighter in weight than their hard analogues. (There are, of course, designs that maximize the \nratio of strength-to-weight for both, but soft structures using pressurized thin walls can combine \nremarkably high stiffness with light weight.)  The thermodynamic efficiencies of most soft \nsystems has not been as carefully defined as have been those in hard ones, but hard robots are \nnot, generally, thermodynamically very efficient, and may thus have high energy costs. \n \nFor Robots of All Kinds: What will the future hold? The integration of human workers with \nincreasingly competent machines – whether hard or soft – seems inevitable. \nParticularly in \nthe countries of the economically developed world with aging populations and a high standard of \nliving, there are entire classes of jobs for which there are currently too few available human \nworkers. Fruit picking, mining, food handling and preparation, house cleaning, military and \npolice operations, eldercare, agricultural field work, garbage disposal, and a range of others: \nthese jobs are sometimes difficult, unpleasant, or dangerous, and it might be better to have them \ndone by machines than by people. Soft machines will be required, or preferred to people, for \nsome of them.  \n \nThe hope, of course, is that jobs that are transferred from humans to machines will allow the \nhumans to take on other, more rewarding jobs. What will they be? The answer to this question is \npresently unknown. It is not impossible to make such replacements beneficial for all involved. \nConsider previous replacements of humans and animals by machines. The horse-drawn cart, \nlocomotive, and automobile were all developed to replace the labor of humans or animals by \nmachines. Washing machines and dishwashers freed (largely) women from these tasks, and \nallowed them tobecome teachers, managers, musicians, bankers, and other skilled professionals. \nThe outcome of the redistribution of “work” among humans, animals, machines, and computers \nis impossible to predict in any detail now, but it is unquestionably one of the most important \nchanges now facing society. Soft robotics will play a part. \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \n \nWhat will be the result of fusion of robots, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine \nlearning?  How will humans be involved? The story of “future technology” is more \ncomplicated than just “humans,” “robots,” and the distribution of physical labor. There is also \nthe enormously important role of future computer systems (the World Wide Web, mobile \ndevices, artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, the Internet of Things (the IoT) and the \nIndustrial IoT (the IIoT), and many other manifestations of “intelligent machines”). There is – at \nleast in my opinion – a critical role for soft robots and actuators to act as intermediaries between \nhumans (who are intrinsically soft, but involved both in physical tasks, and in using \ninformation), robots (which are highly competent machines, albeit with increasing sophistication \nin information processing) and computer systems (which, arguably, already “think,” and are \nmoving—almost certainly—toward “understanding”). The form and function of these \nhuman/robotic/computer interactions, and of hybridized systems combining humans and \nmachines, is presently unpredictable (but include—as physical manifestations—exoskeletons, \nprostheses, manipulators at very large or very small scales, brain-controlled machines, and \nsensors that augment human perception). To the extent that they will involve \nphysical/mechanical contact between humans and machines, soft robotics and systems will be \nimportant. \n \nWhat does the subject of Soft Robotics have to do with Chemistry? A major component of \nsoft systems – from robotics to actuators—will be soft materials—elastomers, flexible sheets, \nfabrics, granules, foams, gels, liquid crystals, liquids, and other forms of matter. Reconfigurable \nsoft robots incorporating harder structural components—such as those designed using the \nprinciples of origami and kirigami[10] —will also be important. As the field develops, certain soft \nsystems will also require structurally rigid components (the equivalent of endo- and \nexoskeletons, intended to provide passive structural strength that soft materials may not \nintrinsically possess), but economics and materials compatibility will probably dictate that these \nmaterials are often also structural polymers rather than metals. Thus, soft robotics offers to \nmaterial science, and thus to chemistry, an enormous range of opportunities to generate new \ntypes of function. The syntheses of super-soft elastomeric bottlebrush polymers by Sheiko,[11] \nsuper-elastic polymers by Suo et al.,[12] and self-healing polymers and structures by Bao[13] and \nShepherd[14] are early examples. Soft Robotics is, and will probably remain, a technology \nfounded on soft, functional, materials, fabricated from molecular precursors, in polyfunctional \ndesigns.   \n \nBackground.  \n  \n \nHard Robotics is a mature field, and has been extensively reviewed.[15] We will not \ndiscuss it further. Soft Robotics has grown sufficiently rapidly that it is already described in \nmany excellent, technologically focused, reviews.[16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24] Rather than trying to \nreplicate or summarize them, we simply list them. We note only that (to paraphrase J.F. \nKennedy, and many others before him) “Victory has many fathers,” and claims in these early \nreviews of who developed what technology first, are still to be adjudicated by history. Two \nhistorical efforts were particularly relevant to our own work. First, a class of pneumatic actuators \nbased on mesh-constrained elastomeric bladders—a kind of semisoft actuator (McKibben \nActuators)—were developed and commercialized in the 1950s.[25]  These systems have been \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \nsuccessful, but were intended primarily to be linear actuators. Second, Suzumori demonstrated \nsimple, elastomer-based actuators in the 1980s.[26] These systems were, in fact, very similar to \nsome of the soft devices that have emerged in the current explosion of work in “soft robotics,” \nand Suzumori was perhaps the first to recognize a part of the potential for this kind of system.   \n \nMy personal (and therefore, limited) perspective is that the field of soft robotics has been able to \ngrow as rapidly as it has as a result of a confluence of six technologies developed independently \nfor other purposes. These include: i) Poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) elastomers as structural \nmaterials that make fabrication convenient (and thus enable rapid prototyping), and possesses a \nnumber of useful properties (transparency, ease of sterilization, biocompatibility, etc.). ii) Soft \nLithography and Microfluidics to form appropriate pneumatic and hydraulic channels. iii) \nDigital Fabrication, especially to aid in making molds. iv) Soft Composites, to generate and \ncontrol anisotropic motion on actuation. v) Computers, and Computer-based Systems, to serve \nfunctions from design and fabrication to control, and vi) Hard Robotics. Hard robotics are \nparticularly important, since they are highly developed, and provide a wide range of important \ncapabilities (from positioning and motion control to visualization) that are also important for soft \nrobotics, reliably and surprisingly affordably.  Together, this set of technologies combine to \nprovide: an elastomeric material with excellent properties, suitable both for prototyping and for \nproduction; fabrication methods taken from well-developed methodologies—soft lithography[27]  \nand PDMS microfluidics;[28] a convenient, flexible method of making the molds required to \nfabricate the networks of pneumatic channels required in most designs; straightforward methods \nof controlling the anisotropy of strain by forming composites of PDMS with flexible but \ninextensible sheets (or other composite designs), and origami/kirigami-based structures[29]; \ndesign, control, and vision tools based on computers; and concepts from hard robotics, and more \nimportantly, from existing, highly engineered hard robotic systems, for use in hard/soft hybrid \nsystems. Which of these technologies persist as important parts of the field of soft devices as it \ndevelops depends on the characteristics of the applications being addressed.  \n  \n \n  \n \nOur Starting Point in Soft Robotics. \n  \n \nThe Beginning: Biomimicry Based on Invertebrates and Higher (but Not Mammalian) \nOrganismic Models:  from Worms to Squid. The starting point for our work in this field was a \nseries of discussions (largely carried out in the 1980s and 90s in a very stimulating working \ngroup – the DSRC, or “Defense Science Research Council” – a group focused heavily on \nmaterials science, and sponsored by DARPA). The possibility of approaches to robotics that \nprovided capabilities beyond those of existing, largely industrial, hard robots was, of course, \nalready a subject of active discussion, and one subject of discussion was always “are there other \nways of doing it?” Most of robotics at that point was based on the idea of modeling humans or \nanimals, or making other mechanical systems (e.g., aircraft or vehicles) more versatile and \npolyfunctional, in order to give them greater capability or autonomy. \n  \nAmong our early interests in the subject of soft robots were the characteristics of animals lacking \ninternal skeletons. All have countless interesting anatomical functions. Worms, for example, \nmove with a sophistication that is still not easy to replicate; starfish provided the first models and \ninspirations for grippers. Squid and octopodes are inspiring examples of very intelligent animals \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \nusing complex motions controlled using strategies quite different from the ones land-animals \nuse. (For example, the tentacles of an octopus are at least partially controlled locally: each \ntentacle has its own complex set of local nerves as a controller.[30]) Insects do not have \nendoskeletons (or, generally, lungs), but they do have exoskeletons. These skeletons enable them \nto move efficiently without buoyant support from water, but they are limited in size by structural \nconstraints, and by restrictions, inter alia, in rates of mass transport of oxygen from air into their \ntissue.  Aspects of all of these functions are now visible in current soft actuators. \n \nDiscussions with DARPA program managers—originally Dr. Mitch Zakin, and later Dr. Gill \nPratt—led to an initial, multi-team project: the “Chemical Robots”, or “ChemBots” program.  \nThe objective of the program was to develop a soft system that would start by looking like a soft-\ndrink can, autonomously unfold, move across the floor, find a door and crawl under it, and \nreconfigure into a something that looked like a soft-drink can on the other side. The ChemBots \nprogram did not, in fact, produce a working example of technology having this level of \ncomplexity, but it provided a number of successful component technologies, and was the very \nsuccessful starting point for technical approaches to soft robotics. Probably as importantly, it \nnucleated the area, and provided initial support for a number of investigators—Rob Wood, \nDaniella Rus, Heinrich Jaeger, Peko Hosoi, Barry Trimmer, Mahadevan—and \nstudents/postdocs—Rob Shepherd, Carmen Majidi, Mike Tolley, Rebecca Kramer, Christoph \nKeplinger, and others—who have subsequently emerged as leaders of the field. \n \nAlthough pneumatic inflation emerged from this program as the most immediately useful method \nof actuation (and certainly the simplest to implement), a number of other interesting approaches \nalso emerged.  For example, Jaeger’s demonstration of pneumatics to accomplish granular \njamming in loose particles, and thus to freeze shapes[31] is particularly interesting for its \ncomplementarity to pneumatic methods that cause large, dynamic changes in shape in soft \nelastomers, and will probably become an important part of the technology of the field in the \nfuture.   \n \n \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

The \n“palm” of the gripper is hard, and attached to a commercial, hard, arm. (Soft Robotics, Inc.). \nBoth rely on PneuNets and pneumatic actuation.  \n \nPneuNets: Initial Work on Soft Actuators.  The initial work in my group was designed to \nprovide the simplest solution we could find to the problem of actuation (Figure 1a). It used the \nexpansion of a bladder (or balloon) constrained by its shape, and either by the anisotropic \nproperties of the elastomeric materials (e.g., combinations of more and less flexible PDMS)[32], \nor by the incorporation of paper- or cloth-based structures into elastomeric composites to control \nanisotropy of motion on actuation.[33] To control the stress, and the distribution of stress, in these \nsystems, we used a number of strategies.  It was often useful to fabricate a network of small \nbladders (rather than a single large one) connected to a common source of pressure to engineer \nthe distribution of strain, and thus shape, in the inflated soft device.  Digital printing made it easy \nto make the molds required to form these microchannel systems (which we called “pneumatic \nnetworks,” or PneuNets) in the PDMS.[34]  \n \n \n \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \nSealing techniques developed in PDMS microfluidics could be used directly with these \npneumatic systems; because we used pressures that were typically only 50 – 100 kPa (0.5 – 1 \natm) relative to ambient pressure, high-strength seals were not required for prototyping. Figure 2 \nillustrates the process used originally; the same principles are still used, albeit with different \ndesigns for the bladders, and different methods of fabrication.     \n \n \nFigure 2.  a-d. Schematic illustration of techniques used to mold and assemble a PDMS/paper \ncomposite. e-h.

All rights reserved \nThe fact that relatively low pressures are involved in these actuators can seem surprising, but it is \ngood to remember that net force scales with pressure and area (F = PA), and 1 atm of pressure \nover 20 in2 (or 130 cm2) is about 130 kg. Since actuation can result either from a positive or \nnegative difference in pressure (that is, from either “applied pressure” or “applied vacuum”) \nacross appropriately designed PneuNets, the same forces can be generated with both. With \nappropriate materials and designs, it should be possible in the future to go to much larger \npressures, and thus much higher applied forces (1 atm of pressure is ~ 1 kg-force cm2). \n  \nThese principles led quickly to a range of demonstrations of soft actuators with biomimetic \nfunctions.   \n \n \n“Starfish Gripper.” The first example of a useful soft device (published in Angew. \nChem.[32] over the objection of the referees, on the grounds that it was “not chemistry”) was a \npentagonal gripper (Figure 1; shown picking up an uncooked egg).  \n \n \nFigure 3.

[36b] with permission. Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. \n \nBecause grippers have proved so important practically, and because this class of actuator is \nrelatively easy to make, many variants on the structures of grippers have already appeared \n(Figure 3). Tentacles[35] have been designed and demonstrated in profusion, stimulated by the \nadmirable dexterity of the octopus.  (All of these demonstrations, and certainly including ours, \nfall far short of the capability of even the least capable cephalopods, and have essentially nothing \nto do with the anatomy, sensory system, and control with which they generate their extraordinary \nmotions.) Simple Walkers[36] proved easy to make, although not so far useful. They have, \nhowever, provided a useful test bed for the development of autonomous, mobile systems. \nExploring other possibilities led to a number of interesting, if odd, functions. For example a \n“Chameleon’s Tongue”[37] demonstrated the ability of a soft actuator to move surprisingly \nrapidly (complete coiling of a tentacle[34] requires less than 200 msec.), and “Combustion-driven \nJumpers” [38] demonstrated that it would be possible to generate substantial pressure on-board \n(by filling the PneuNet with a methane-air mixture, and then igniting it with a spark).[39] Other \nmethods of generating pressure internally – for example, the decomposition of hydrogen \nperoxide to oxygen and water[40]—have also been demonstrated, but have not so far proved \npractically useful. Perhaps (at least in the long term) a more interesting demonstration is that of \nthe use of the microfluidic function built into soft devices for functions other than motion. For \nexample, Fluidic Transport for Observation, Delivery, and Sampling[35b] can transport reagents \nto an object or a test sample, examine its environment, and retrieve fluids from a test site, with \nalmost no modification of the robot other than adding another small fluidic channel for transport \nof fluids. \n \nThe same type of microfluidic system provides the basis for a walker that capable of \nCamouflage[41] (reflecting exchange of fluids in microchannel systems in the PDMS structure); \nthis walker could show independent patterns in visible and IR spectral regions. (Camouflage has \nproved a subject of enduring interest in soft robotics, stimulated in part by the marvelous abilities \nof the octopus.) Non-Biological Functions. Similar uses of small channels in non-soft-robotic \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \napplications (e.g., microfluidics) had established the value of microchannels in fabricating \noptical waveguides and small dye lasers, flexible electrical conductors, and current carriers for \ngenerating magnetic fields using the same methods of fabrication[42]. Incorporation of a small \ncamera (taken from a cell phone) on the tip of a tentacle, coupled to a computer either using a \nfiber optic or Bluetooth link, gave these simple systems “eyes.”[35b, 36b]  \n \nTethered vs. Non-Tethered Systems: Power. Most of these demonstrations have involved \nactuation by compressed gas from an external source, and thus require a gas-transfer line \nconnecting the actuator to this source. Actuators that are connected to stationery, external power \nsources are called “tethered.” It is still an unresolved and still contentious issue as to whether \ntethering is an important limitation of these systems or not. In practice, many existing hard \nrobots—robots used on manufacturing lines, for example – are tethered. A smaller, but important \nset of robots—robots used for warehouse management, floor cleaning, and tasks requiring \nmovement over large areas (airborne drones, autonomous vehicles) – are, and must be, \nuntethered. Designing large, soft robots that are untethered and mobile, using PDMS and low \npressures, is difficult, simply because it is not straightforward for the body of a soft robot to \nsupport its own weight, plus the weight of the power supply, compressor, valves, and control \nrequired for complete autonomy[36b]. The question of how important this limitation is, is still \nbeing actively discussed, but if it is important, it almost certainly can be solved using stronger \nelastomers and higher pressures. In practice (see below), most current applications of soft \nactuators are in systems in which they are combined with hard robots; hard robots can operate \neither in tethered or untethered mode, and – if needed – provide power for soft robots. \n  \nBiomimetic Function, but Not Biomimetic Mechanism. An important point of emphasis is the \nmeaning of “biomimetic.” These PneuNet-based systems (and others) were designed to mimic \nthe function of biological systems: that is the ability to change shape, exert force, and do work. \nThey were not designed to mimic the mechanism by which organisms accomplish these \nfunctions (using muscle, or specialized structures such as hydrostats.) Although the literature is \nreplete with references to “artificial muscle,” none of these structures-- although interestingly \ndesigned, and possibly useful-- mimic any of the biochemistry—the ATP dependent interaction \nof myosin and actin fibers—that underlies the contraction of muscle (Figure 5).    \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nFigure 5.  (left) Human arm showing the biceps muscle, and (right) a PneuNet structure that \ncombines negative (sub-atmospheric) pressure and reversibly buckling elastomeric beams to \nmimic the function of this muscle[43].

PneuNets, actuated using positive and/or negative (sub-atmospheric) \npressures, have provided a starting point for providing power to soft devices, and have illustrated \nsome of the motions available to them. One of the features distinguishing soft and hard devices \nis, however, the nature of their response to actuation.  Hard robots are generally designed to be \nlinear in their response to their controllers. One of the interesting and differentiating features \nabout soft materials, is that—especially when operated with minimal controls—their response to \nactuation is often non-linear.  This characteristic is one basis for their adaptability, but can make \nthem more difficult to control than linear systems.  We consider non-linearity an advantage \n(although one requiring management) rather than a disadvantage, in that it allows the generation \nof very complex motions using very simple actuation (for example, Figure 6a).  One example of \na useful class of non-linear motions available in soft robotics is buckling. \n  \nBuckling and Other Non-Linearities of Materials.   \n \n \nFor most hard materials, buckling is a mechanism of failure. As one increases the \npressure on a concrete pillar, for example, its response (compressive strain) will be small, until it \nfails catastrophically. Soft beams also buckle (that is, at some pressure they show a large and \nnonlinear response), but this buckling is reversible, and hence a useful mechanism for actuation \nthat is not available in hard materials (Figures 5, 6).  \n \n \nFigure 6. Two structures illustrating “snap-through” (a useful form of non-linearity in soft \nstructures).  a.  An “arm” of a starfish gripper that—on uniform pneumatic actuation—curls non-\nuniformly, starting from the tip. Reproduced from Ref. [32] with permission. Copyright 2011, \nJohn Wiley & Sons. b. A hollow, elastomeric beam that—when compressed—buckles and \ncrimps (thereby blocking the flow of air through the tube):  this structure can serve as a soft \nvalve \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \n \nBuckling, and nonlinear properties of materials, have been extensively studied. Our work in soft \nmaterials has relied both on empirical observation of prototypes of soft devices, and (heavily) on \nbeautiful studies by our colleagues Bertoldi[44], Suo[43], and Mahadevan[45].  Figures 5 and 6 \nprovide examples of the application of buckling in actuation.  The structure in Figures 5 \nparticularly interesting: this structure contracts linearly on application of vacuum, and this \nmotion results from the buckling of a series of internal elastomeric beams.[43, 46] It is—so far as \nwe know—the structure that comes closest to mimicking the behavior and functional \ncharacteristics (but certainly not the molecular mechanism) of biological muscle. \n \n \n \nPneumatic Origami Structures, and Structures with “Semi-soft” Components. Another \nbroadly useful class of structures are those in which the strength of soft materials is increased by \nadding flexible but non-elastic components.  Figure 7 shows two examples.  \n \nFigure 7. a. A PDMS tube, reinforced with a paper origami strain-limiting structure, lifts a heavy \nweight on pressurization. Reproduced from Ref. [33] with permission. Copyright 2012, John \nWiley & Sons. b. An arthrobot, in which the combination of flexible but non-elastic tubes \n(polyolefin drinking straws) and PDMS balloons (inside these tubes) provides a joint that mimics \nfunctional aspects of the joints of a spider. \n \nThe upper figure shows a “lifter” that has an origami structure of folded paper embedded in a \nthin, circular PDMS membrane.[33] This type of structure provides sufficient compressive \nstrength to lift a remarkably heavy weight (as a multiple of its own weight).  Extensions of this \nprinciple have recently demonstrated grippers with potentially useful strength.  Figure 7 also \nshows what we call an “arthrobot.”[47] This walking structure is loosely modeled on arthropods, \nwhich have hard (chitin, for ants) or semi-hard (for spiders) exoskeletons. This particular \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \nstructure has six legs (as does an ant) but joints whose mechanism of action is modeled on those \nof a spider (whose joints are, surprisingly—for such a complicated organism—among some of \nthe simpler joints found in arthropods). The structural strength is provided by circular tubes \n(polypropylene drinking straws, chosen for their availability, light weight, high strength, and low \ncost).   \n \nThe Materials Science of Soft Robots. Most of the initial work in soft robotics has been devoted \nto demonstrating elementary designs: of these, PneuNets,[34] and analogs of them, have so far \nproved the most broadly useful. For most of this work, commercial elastomers (especially \nPDMS, with occasional applications of elastomeric polyurethanes) have been the materials of \nchoice. PDMS has been especially useful because its properties are “good enough” (and perhaps \nin some cases optimally good) for both academic prototypes and initial commercial products, and \nbecause it is particularly easy to mold and seal. Silicone elastomers also come in a very wide \nrange of structures and properties; the family of siloxanes has the versatility required to solve \nmany problems in soft materials science. The fabrication of PneuNets has also benefited from the \nfact that much of the technology needed for academic demonstrations of soft robotics has been \nable to exploit (often without modification) fabrication methods developed for PDMS-based \nmicrofluidic systems. Further, composite structures—structures fabricated with heterogeneous \nstructures—typically incorporating elastomers with different mechanical properties and with \nflexible but inextensible sheet materials (paper, glass fiber, mesh, cloth)—have proved an \nintegral part of soft robotics (Figure 8).  \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

All rights reserved \n \n \nElastomeric composites are much less extensively explored than composites of hard materials \n(where they are, of course, at the heart of the design of materials-based structures).  It is routine \nto embed flexible sheets into PDMS structures to limit and direct their strain under the stress of \ninflation. By using origami or kirigami sheets, fibers, or flexible beams, a wide range of \ninteresting and useful behaviors can be achieved with minimal changes in methods of \nfabrication. \n  \nAlthough composite structures are central to materials science, soft-matter composites are \nrelatively unexplored, and the broader opportunity for introduction of new types of soft, \ncomposite materials into soft robotics is enormous. Chemistry has produced a very wide range of \nelastomeric materials, ranging from very soft gels to very tough particle- and fiber-reinforced \nrubbers (e.g., for tires). Very little of this range has yet to be explored as materials of \nconstruction for soft, “ultra-soft” or “hard-soft” robotics. Design and preparation of elastomeric \nmaterials with useful electromagnetic and optical properties is also just beginning. Biomedical \napplications will require careful engineering of mechanics, surfaces, biocompatibility, and gas-\ntransport properties.  \n \n \nThe Material as the Controller: “Intelligent Materials.” A concept that has emerged \nfrom initial work in soft robotics—one that differentiates it from hard robots—is that of “the \nmaterial as the controller.” Hard robots are almost entirely dependent upon systems of sensors \nand active controllers: for example, for a gripper, pressure sensors in the “fingers” sense pressure \nor force on the object being gripped, and use that information to compute appropriate forces \nsupplied, often by electrical motors, to provide adequate—but not damaging—gripping.[9] Much \nof this complexity can be eliminated with soft robots, albeit at the cost of reduced multi-finger \ndexterity.  Because soft fingers are compliant, they can, however, adapt to complex surfaces \nautonomously, and distribute pressure in a way that limits damage to the object being gripped \n(Figure 1).  Allowing the material (and the design) to control the pressure exerted by the gripper \nalso allows much simplified control (in fact, in some applications, control limited to the applied \npneumatic pressure), and safe manipulation of complex and fragile objects.  \n \n \nEngineering Properties. Establishing the properties of engineered materials—and the \nrequired materials databases—required to develop commercial products is an arduous process in \nwhich useful information accumulates with increasing volumes of application. Although relevant \ndevelopment research is just beginning, there are a range of indicators-- both from current work, \nand from accumulated experience using elastomers in other applications-- to guide expectations. \nCycle Lifetimes. How many times can an actuator bend before it begins to fail? Simple bending \ntests with PDMS fingers and tentacles suggest that millions of cycles are possible with only \nsmall changes in stress-strain relationships.[34, 46a] Damage Resistance. PDMS-based structures \nare remarkably resistant to damage on blunt impact. For example, because they are so light, it is \nalmost impossible to damage them by dropping, and it is possible to drive an automobile over a \nwalker without damage. Elastomers can also be astonishingly tough: fiber- and particle-\nreinforced truck tires are among the most durable of human-engineered structures. By contrast, \nPDMS and soft hydrogels fracture easily when cut (especially under tension). New types of very \ntough gels—typically inter-penetrating polymer networks—are, however, now appearing.[12, 50]  \n\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved \n \nRelatively little detailed information relevant to the engineering of properties relevant to specific \napplications in soft systems is yet available. Comparisons between hard and soft systems may be \ndifficult, since their properties are so different. “Wear” Is an example that suggests the \ndifficulties of making comparisons.  When a soft “finger” or tentacle bends, stress is stored as \nstrain (reflecting changes in the conformation of the constituent polymer chains). Strain-induced \nchanges in the elastomer may result in accelerated aging, and thus in changes in bending \nmodulus. By contrast, when a hard “finger” bends, sliding friction between hard surfaces in \njoints or bearings can cause frictional wear, and perhaps require lubrication and cleaning. Correct \ncomparison of hard and soft systems is thus, in practice, difficult, since their motions are so \ndifferent. Other Properties.  A wide variety of other properties are relevant to specific uses of \nsoft robots and actuators: surface textures for grippers, ease of sterilization, resistance to \ntemperature or chemical corrosion, permeability, weight, optical and electromagnetic properties, \nbiocompatibility, cost, and many others must be considered on a case-by-case basis. It is, \nhowever, clear that in some applications—handling food, tissue, and humans, picking up soft \nobjects of irregular shapes, fitting into small or irregular spaces, operation in the presence of \ncorrosive agents, and others—soft systems may be successful in applications that would be very \ndifficult for hard systems. \n \n  \nNew Directions \n \n \nNew Actuators. Most of the work in soft robotics has used a limited set of elastomers as \nmaterials, and pressurized air, or vacuum, for power. There is certainly interest in alternatives, \nparticularly those that would use electricity.  Some of this interest is probably more based on \nfamiliarity, and the technological maturity of electrically- and combustion-actuated systems \n(electrical and IC motors, batteries, electrically controlled solenoids and valves), than on a \ncareful comparison of the characteristics and applications of hard and soft robots. Suo[51], \nKeplinger[52], Bauer[53] and others have demonstrated effective methods of electrical actuation \nrelevant to soft robotics using dielectric elastomers, and others will certainly be examined, but \nstrict electromagnetic analogs of hard robots have been slow to develop.  Perhaps more \nimportantly, an electrically-driven soft robot may simply not be as useful as a soft, \npneumatically-driven, adaptive one in broad classes of applications.  Efforts to use chemistry \n(either in terms of molecules with high free energy, such as H2O2, or by combustion) have not, so \nfar, proved practically useful in powering soft robots, although they work to a limited extent.[38-\n40, 54] Fuel cells compatible with soft structures provide an obvious, and largely unexplored \napproach to hybrids combining chemical fuels and electrical actuators/controllers, but would \nrequire hard components. Soft supercapacitors might also be useful. Other types of actuations—\nfor example, strain release in tightly wound, pre-stressed fibers (a concept developed by \nBaughman[55]) may also be interesting for some specific applications. That said, pneumatic \nactuation has proved so simple to implement in prototypes that no better method has yet \nemerged, and the problem of providing (or at least testing) a broader range of options for \nactivation of soft machines represents a largely-unexplored opportunity.  \n \n  \n \nNew Materials: Elastomers, Composites, Gels, Foams, Particles.
