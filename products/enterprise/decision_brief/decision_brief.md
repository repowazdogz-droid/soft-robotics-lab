### Temporal Analysis [D]

| Horizon | Implications | Risks | Opportunities |
|---------|--------------|-------|----------------|
| T1 (0-1y) | Portfolio allocation, quick wins | Resource and timeline uncertainty | Alignment with stated objectives |
| T2 (1-5y) | Roadmap commitment, capability build | Resource and timeline uncertainty | Alignment with stated objectives |
| T3 (5-30y) | Infrastructure, ecosystems (5-30y) | Resource and timeline uncertainty | Alignment with stated objectives |
| T4 (30+y) | Intergenerational, planetary (30+y) | Resource and timeline uncertainty | Alignment with stated objectives |

### Validation Trinity [D]

- **SRFC (Feasibility):** GREEN - Params sufficient for feasibility check
- **TSRFC (Workflow):** AMBER - Workflow replacement scope implied by query
- **VRFC (Reality):** AMBER - Multi-domain strategy requires coordination validation

---

### Stakeholders [D]

- **Who pays:** Primary budget owner; Strategy/PMO
- **Who benefits:** Decision sponsor; End users if adopted
- **Who loses:** Alternatives foregone
- **Adoption barriers:** Resource constraint; Organizational alignment; Portfolio trade-offs

---

### Plural Futures [D]

1. **Conservative:** Minimal change, focus on de-risking and reversible steps.
   - Probability: 40%
   - Trade-offs: Lower upside, Slower time-to-value, Preserves optionality
   - Failure modes: Opportunity cost, Competitor move first, Drift from market

2. **Balanced:** Phased commitment with checkpoints and clear go/no-go.
   - Probability: 35%
   - Trade-offs: Moderate risk/reward, Requires discipline, Adaptable
   - Failure modes: Checkpoint creep, Resource dilution, Delayed payoff

3. **Aggressive:** Full commitment to chosen direction; fast execution.
   - Probability: 25%
   - Trade-offs: Higher upside, Less reversible, Requires alignment
   - Failure modes: Overcommit, Execution gaps, External shock

---

### Substrate Interactions [D]

- **materials:** Decision touches materials; impact derived from query and domain.
- **compute:** Compute for control/simulation; materials for end-effector.
- **manufacturing:** Assembly and integration; tooling and fixtures.
- **coordination:** Cross-domain coordination and resource allocation.
- **environment:** Decision touches environment; impact derived from query and domain.

---

### Recommended Action [D]

Proceed with phased pilot; set go/no-go checkpoint at 90 days and re-assess.

---

### Confidence & Uncertainty [D]

**What we know:**
- Params provided and used for feasibility
- Domain mapping applied

**What we don't know:**
- Execution context
- External factors
- Timeline variance

---

### Approval [D]

- **Requires approval:** Yes
- **Reason:** Feasibility or reality check at AMBER; approval recommended.

---

### Audit Trail [D]

1. Parsed query and detected domains: strategy
1. Params complete for domain check
1. Computed T1-T4 implications (deterministic)
1. Computed stakeholders (deterministic)
1. Computed SRFC/TSRFC/VRFC (deterministic)
1. Aggregated overall status: AMBER
1. Computed 3 trajectories (plural futures)
1. Computed substrate analysis
1. LLM enrichment skipped (unavailable or error)
