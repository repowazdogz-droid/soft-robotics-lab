### To *use* OmegaStack now

In a terminal:

```bat
(base) C:\Users\Warren> conda activate compute
(compute) C:\Users\Warren> cd C:\Users\Warren\OmegaStack
(compute) C:\Users\Warren\OmegaStack> omega_launch.bat
```

Then you’ll see the **menu** and can choose:

1 → Status / snapshot
2 → Topics overview
3 → Planner / query
4 → Execution plans
5 → Devices report
6 → Futures view
7 → Research loop
8 → Full snapshot


  * **cursor block** (code to paste / save)
  * **terminal block** (exact command to run)
* When I’m **not** sending blocks →
  You can just use `omega_launch.bat` and explore.

So the only things I ever need from you are:

1. **Paste/save cursor blocks** in the right files
2. **Run terminal blocks** exactly as given
3. Occasionally tell me “what you see” if we’re debugging

Omega = architect + operator logic
You = hands on keyboard when needed.

## 4. What’s next on PC path (no action needed yet)

For the **next big phase**, I’ll lead on:

* XR / Vision Pro / Quest 3 bridge
* Education & emotional-intelligence layer
* Creative/world-building hooks
