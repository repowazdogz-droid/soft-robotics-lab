# Spine Contract 25 — Research Ingestion & Evidence Discipline

## Purpose
Ensure Omega ingests research rigorously without bias, hype, or contamination.

This contract enforces evidence discipline and prevents narrative drift.

This contract is strict, boring, and enforceable.

---

## 1. What Qualifies as Research

### Accepted
- Peer-reviewed academic papers
- Technical reports with explicit methodology
- Primary data with clear provenance
- Documented field observations
- Reproducible experiments

### Rejected
- Opinion pieces
- Marketing or promotional material
- Anonymous or unattributed claims
- Social engagement metrics
- Unverified summaries

Rejected inputs are not stored.

---

## 2. Source Classification

Each research input must be explicitly labeled as:

- Primary / Secondary / Tertiary
- Empirical / Theoretical / Anecdotal
- Internal / External
- Time-sensitive / Stable

Unlabeled inputs are ignored.

---

## 3. Ingestion Gates

Research is ingested only if:

- Source is identifiable
- Methodology is stated
- Limitations are explicit
- Assumptions are declared

Failure on any gate results in quarantine.

Quarantined research is not used for reasoning.

---

## 4. Evidence Weighting

Evidence is weighted by:

- Methodological rigor
- Relevance to the current decision context
- Recency where applicable
- Independence from other sources

No single source may dominate.

---

## 5. Conflict Handling

When sources conflict:

- Disagreement is surfaced explicitly
- Contradictions are not averaged away
- Minority findings are preserved
- Overall uncertainty is increased

---

## 6. Hype Suppression

Omega must:

- Reduce claims to testable statements
- Ignore novelty as a signal
- Downweight sensational language
- Avoid trend-following behavior

---

## 7. Research Decay

Omega must:

- Timestamp all research inputs
- Periodically revalidate key claims
- Explicitly expire stale findings

Expired research is not reused silently.

---

## 8. Separation from Learning

Research ingestion does not equal learning.

Learning requires outcome feedback and is governed by the learning loop contract.

---

## 9. Human Oversight

Human operators may:

- Whitelist sources
- Blacklist domains
- Override evidence weighting
- Demand justification

---

## 10. Audit Trail

All ingested research must retain:

- Source reference
- Ingestion date
- Assigned weight
- Usage context

This contract changes only via explicit revision.
