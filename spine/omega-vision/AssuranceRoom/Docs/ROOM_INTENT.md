# AssuranceRoom — Intent

AssuranceRoom is a static spatial reasoning surface.

AssuranceRoom visualizes objectives, constraints, feasible regions, and tensions without optimization or recommendation.

It makes assurances visible as objects, and shows:
- objectives
- constraints
- feasible regions
- assurance tensions

It does not:
- optimize outcomes
- recommend "best" options
- run simulations
- claim correctness
- select solutions

Human-led. Non-autonomous. Visual reasoning only.
