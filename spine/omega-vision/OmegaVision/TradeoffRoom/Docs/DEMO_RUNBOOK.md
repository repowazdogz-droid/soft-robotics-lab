# TradeoffRoom — Demo Runbook (V1)

15-second intro (say this verbatim):
"This is a visual tradeoff surface. It shows objectives, constraints, and uncertainty — but it does not optimize, recommend, or simulate. Nothing moves unless we move the camera."

45-second flow:
1) Toggle Objectives: "These are goals we may care about (not ranked)."
2) Toggle Constraints: "These are boundaries that shape what's feasible."
3) Show Feasible Region: "This volume indicates what's possible under constraints — it's not a solution."
4) Show Tradeoff Front: "These points represent different compromises — not 'the best'."
5) Show Uncertainty: "These halos mark areas of incomplete knowledge."

If asked "Which should we pick?"
Say:
"It doesn't pick. It helps you see what's being traded off so humans can decide."

Stop conditions:
- If someone asks for a recommendation/optimization: restate boundary and stop.
- If someone expects motion/simulation: restate "not a simulator" and stop.
