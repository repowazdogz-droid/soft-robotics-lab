# CAUSALROOM V1 — LOCKED

CausalRoom V1 is a **static, conceptual causal reasoning surface**. It shows nodes, links, disallowed links, and uncertainty halos — as visual aids for thinking, not as simulators or decision engines.

## What V1 Is
- **Nodes**: 6 conceptual nodes (N1–N6) arranged in a ring
- **Links**: 4 allowed causal links (illustrative, not asserted truth)
- **Disallowed Links**: 3 boundary markers (explicit "not allowed" constraints)
- **Uncertainty**: 2 halos around nodes N2 and N5
- **Inspector**: Read-only metadata for selected elements

## Allowed Interactions (V1)
- **Camera**: Look/walk (head pose movement)
- **Toggles**: Show/hide layers (Nodes, Links, Disallowed Links, Uncertainty)
- **Select**: Tap nodes or links to view metadata
- **Inspect**: Read-only inspector panel
- **Reset**: Reset view (camera/state only)

## Explicit Disallowed Features
- **Simulation**: No time evolution, no physics, no dynamics
- **Prediction**: No forecasting, no "what if" scenarios
- **Optimization**: No "best" selection, no scoring
- **Recommendations**: No advice, no "do X" language
- **Weights/Strength**: No sliders for link strength or certainty
- **Arrows**: No arrowheads implying causation certainty (direction only in inspector text)
- **Editing**: No in-app creation/deletion of nodes or links
- **Run Buttons**: No "simulate" or "execute" actions
- **Auto-suggestions**: No system-generated recommendations

## Failure Signal
**If it starts to feel like a simulator, it has failed.**

## Change Policy
Only bugfixes and copy clarifications allowed without creating V2.
