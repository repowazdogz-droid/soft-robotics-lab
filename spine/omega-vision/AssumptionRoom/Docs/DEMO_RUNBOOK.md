# AssumptionRoom Demo Runbook (VisionOS)

## 15-Second Intro Script

"This is AssumptionRoom — a spatial reasoning surface that makes assumptions visible. It shows assumptions, conflicts, unsupported regions, and uncertainty. It does not judge, predict, or recommend. Human-led, non-autonomous, visual reasoning only."

## 45-Second Flow

### 1) Select A2 (10s)
- Tap assumption A2
- Show Inspector: "Data representativeness" (or preset-specific title)
- Point out: "This shows what assumptions are carrying the reasoning — not whether they're true."

### 2) Toggle Unsupported ON, Select U1 (10s)
- Toggle "Unsupported" layer ON
- Tap U1 marker
- Show Inspector: "Missing measurement coverage"
- Point out: "This highlights gaps, not commands."

### 3) Select Conflict C1 (10s)
- Tap conflict volume C1
- Show Inspector: "A1 conflicts with observed variability"
- Point out: "This shows tensions between assumptions, not verdicts."

### 4) Switch Preset (10s)
- Change preset from "Research Reasoning" to "Clinical Workflow"
- Show: assumption titles change in Inspector (A2 becomes "Signals reflect patient state")
- Emphasize: "Only labels change. No new objects. No new interactions."

### 5) Reset View (5s)
- Tap "Reset View"
- Camera resets, selection clears
- Return to default state

## Pressure Questions & Safe Answers

**"So what should we do?"**
→ "This room doesn't choose. It shows what assumptions are carrying the reasoning. You decide what to do with that information."

**"Is this validated?"**
→ "Conceptual visualization only. It makes assumptions visible, not validated."

**"Does it predict outcomes?"**
→ "No. It shows assumptions and boundaries. No predictions, no forecasts."

**"Can it tell me which assumption is most important?"**
→ "No. It doesn't rank or prioritize. It makes assumptions visible so you can reason about them."

**"Does it remember what I selected?"**
→ "No. Each selection is independent. No cross-session memory."

## Stop Condition

**If audience asks for recommendations/validation/predictions:**
1. Stop the demo
2. Restate trust contract: "This room shows assumptions and boundaries — not decisions, not advice, not validation."
3. Return to gallery or reset view
4. Do not attempt to demonstrate capabilities that don't exist

## Safety Checklist (Before Demo)
- Confirm room launches with Research Reasoning preset
- Confirm all 4 layer toggles work
- Confirm assumptions A1–A6 are selectable
- Confirm conflicts C1–C2 are selectable (volumes, not outlines)
- Confirm unsupported markers U1–U2 are selectable
- Confirm halos H1–H2 are NOT selectable
- Confirm preset switching changes Inspector titles only
- Confirm trust footer is visible: "Human-led. Non-autonomous. Visual reasoning only. Not a simulation."
