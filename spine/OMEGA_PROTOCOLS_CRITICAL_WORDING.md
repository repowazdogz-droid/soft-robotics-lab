# Omega Protocols — Critical Wording Sections

## 1. Home Page / Hero Tagline + Subcopy

**Note:** The Omega Protocol site is documentation-focused and doesn't have a traditional hero section. The closest equivalents are:

**Core Identity:**
- **Tagline:** "Omega Protocol — Infrastructure for reasoning under uncertainty"
- **Title:** "OMEGA — Human-led cognitive infrastructure"
- **Meta Description:** "Omega Protocol provides structured methods for examining claims, systems, and decisions without prescribing outcomes."

**Core Innovation Statement:**
"Protocols that make decision structure visible—assumptions, ownership gaps, and stop conditions—before action hardens into outcomes.

Omega Protocols address a specific gap: high-stakes decisions are made under pressure, but the structure of those decisions (who owns what, what must be assumed, what would trigger a pause) remains invisible. The innovation is not in making better decisions—it's in making decision structure inspectable."

## 2. CTA Language (Buttons + Sections)

**Note:** The Omega Protocol site is infrastructure-focused and does not include traditional CTAs like "Want help applying…", "Work with me", or "Contact to apply". The site emphasizes open access and optional engagement.

**Navigation Labels:**
- "What Omega Is"
- "How It's Used"
- "Protocols"
- "Stewardship"
- "Contact"

**No explicit CTAs found** — The site is designed to be self-service documentation with optional contact for collaboration.

## 3. Stewardship / Pricing / Access Model

**Core statement:**
- "Omega Protocol is maintained as infrastructure for reasoning under uncertainty. The protocols are designed to be descriptive, not prescriptive — exposing structure without prescribing outcomes."

**Principles:**
- **Neutrality** — Protocols do not favor outcomes or perspectives
- **Clarity** — Structure without unnecessary complexity
- **Accessibility** — Usable without specialized training
- **Stability** — Core structures remain consistent over time

**Governance:**
- Changes to core protocols follow structured review and versioning. Core structures remain stable; examples and applications evolve through use.

**Use, Access, and Pricing:**

**Core statement:**
- "Omega Protocol is open infrastructure."
- "The protocols themselves are free to use, adapt, and apply in any context. No license, subscription, or permission is required."

**How Omega Is Funded:**
- Omega is sustained through **contextual application**, not gated access.
- We engage selectively in:
  - institutional applications
  - industry-specific implementations
  - facilitated workshops or reviews
  - bespoke protocol extensions
  - long-horizon research or policy collaborations

**Pricing Philosophy:**
- There is no universal price list.
- Pricing reflects:
  - scale and complexity of the context
  - institutional capacity and resources
  - duration and depth of engagement
  - whether work is exploratory, applied, or embedded
- Industries and institutions with greater resources subsidize broader access.

**Public & Community Use:**
- Individuals, educators, community groups, and under-resourced contexts are encouraged to use Omega freely.
- No approval is required.
- No reporting is expected.
- No usage is monitored.
- When support is needed, we explore formats that preserve accessibility without introducing dependency or obligation.

**How Engagement Happens:**
- Omega is not sold in a traditional sense.
- Most collaborations begin when:
  - people encounter the protocols
  - recognize their value
  - reach out to explore fit
- If there is alignment, we proceed.
- If not, the protocols remain available regardless.
- Omega is infrastructure first.
- Engagement is optional.

## 4. Contact Page Wording

**Opening statement:**
- "Omega Protocol is open infrastructure."
- "Most use does not require contact or permission."
- "For questions, context, or potential collaboration, you can reach us below."

**What to use this for:**
- questions about Omega protocols
- discussion of applications or contexts
- stewardship or governance topics
- invitations to collaborate or explore fit

**Note:**
- "You do not need to pitch, justify, or formalize an inquiry."

**Technical matters:**
- "For Omega RC (the web tool), implementation issues, or bugs, please refer to the documentation or submit an issue report where applicable."

**Form context:**
- Form source field: "Omega Protocol website"
- Subject lines: "Contact Form Submission - Omega Protocol"
- From email: "Omega Protocol <no-reply@omegaprotocol.org>"

## 5. Footer Wording

**Footer Text:**
- "Omega Protocol — Infrastructure for reasoning under uncertainty"

**Note:** The footer does not repeat "services" language. It maintains the infrastructure/infrastructure positioning.
