# Shared Reality Programme — Block 3
## Pilot Design (Platfform / APCymru Ready)

---

## 1. Pilot Purpose

The pilot exists to answer one question:

**"Does creating shared understanding earlier reduce escalation, distress, and harm later?"**

This is not a trial of people.
It is a test of **situational alignment**.

---

## 2. Pilot Shape (Standard)

**Duration:** 4–6 weeks  
**Intensity:** Light-touch, low burden  
**Delivery:** Human-facilitated (no tech dependency)  
**Participants:** 8–20 per cohort  

Designed to fit around real work.

---

## 3. Who the Pilot Is For

Each pilot selects **one primary context**:

- Mental health / wellbeing services (Platfform)
- ND support & advocacy (AP Cymru)
- Schools / education support teams
- Community & third-sector services

Mixed cohorts are allowed **only if** they share a real operating context.

---

## 4. Pilot Structure (Phases)

### Phase 1 — Orientation (Week 1)

**Goal:** Create safety and shared language.

- Intro session (90 mins)
- Explain "Shared Reality" in plain terms
- Set ground rules:
  - no fixing
  - no blaming
  - no forced agreement
- Establish what *this is not* (therapy, assessment, performance review)

**Output:**
- Shared understanding of purpose
- Psychological safety baseline

---

### Phase 2 — Pressure Mapping (Week 2)

**Goal:** Surface where strain actually lives.

Facilitated mapping of:
- moments of overload
- misunderstandings
- ND-specific friction points
- handoff failures
- decision pressure points

No scoring. No diagnosis.

**Output:**
- 1–2 shared "pressure maps"
- Clear articulation of where harm risk emerges

---

### Phase 3 — Shared Reality Sessions (Weeks 3–4)

**Goal:** Align perspectives around real situations.

2–3 facilitated sessions:
- One real situation per session
- Multiple viewpoints expressed safely
- Differences held, not resolved
- Focus on "what each person is responding to"

**ND adaptations:**
- Multiple expression modes (spoken, written, visual)
- Extra processing time
- Explicit permission to pause or disengage

**Output:**
- Shared situational understanding
- Reduced misattribution ("they don't care" → "they see something different")

---

### Phase 4 — Decision Moments Support (Week 5)

**Goal:** Improve decisions under pressure.

Identify:
- moments where decisions escalate harm
- where people act too fast or too late

Practice:
- pause points
- shared checks
- "what are we responding to right now?"

**Output:**
- 2–3 agreed pause practices
- Clearer decision ownership

---

### Phase 5 — Reflection & Evaluation (Week 6)

**Goal:** Capture learning without judgement.

- What changed?
- What didn't?
- Where did shared reality help?
- Where did it fail?

**Output:**
- Pilot learning summary
- Go / No-Go recommendation for scaling

---

## 5. Outcomes We Measure (Non-Clinical)

We **do not** measure wellbeing directly.

We look for:
- fewer escalations
- fewer complaints
- clearer decisions
- reduced rework
- improved trust
- staff confidence at decision points

All qualitative, light-touch, ethical.

---

## 6. Evidence We Collect

- Before/after reflection prompts
- Facilitator observation notes
- Participant language shifts
- Decision clarity examples
- ND participant feedback (voluntary)

No surveillance.
No individual scoring.

---

## 7. What Makes This Safe

- Human-led facilitation
- No data extraction
- No behavioural labelling
- No forced disclosure
- Clear exit at any point

This builds **capacity**, not dependency.

---

## 8. Platfform-Specific Fit

- Aligns with trauma-informed practice
- Supports recovery-oriented language
- Reduces crisis escalation load
- Improves staff confidence without burnout

---

## 9. AP Cymru / ND Fit

- Validates different realities
- Reduces pressure to mask
- Makes misunderstanding visible early
- Improves stakeholder understanding without "training ND people"

---

## 10. Pilot Success Criteria

The pilot is successful if:

- Participants say "we see things differently now"
- Leaders report clearer decisions
- ND voices feel more accurately understood
- Escalation reduces or slows
- The organisation wants to continue
