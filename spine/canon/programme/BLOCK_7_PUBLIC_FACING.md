# BLOCK 7 — PUBLIC-FACING EXPLANATION & BUYER TRANSLATION
Shared Reality Programme

**Status:** Canonical  
**Purpose:** Make the programme legible, safe, and compelling to non-technical, non-specialist audiences  
**Constraint:** Must be understandable without theory, jargon, or defensiveness  

---

## 1. WHY THIS BLOCK EXISTS

The Shared Reality Programme fails if:
- It sounds like therapy
- It sounds like compliance
- It sounds like AI
- It sounds like blame
- It sounds abstract

This block translates the work into language that:
- Frontline staff trust
- Leaders understand
- Commissioners can justify
- ND communities feel safe with

Without distortion.

## 2. THE SIMPLE EXPLANATION (ANY AUDIENCE)

**One sentence**
> "Shared Reality helps people see the same situation clearly, before pressure turns into harm."

**Two sentences**
> "Most problems don't happen because people don't care.  
> They happen because people are acting from different versions of what's going on."

**Thirty-second explanation**
> "When teams are under pressure, everyone is doing their best — but often from different understandings of the same situation. Shared Reality creates a safe pause where people can see what's really happening from all sides, align their understanding, and make safer decisions before things escalate."

## 3. WHAT IT IS / WHAT IT ISN'T

**It is**
- A facilitated way to reduce accidental harm
- A shared understanding process
- A practical support for hard moments
- A way to include ND voices properly
- A decision-quality improvement tool

**It is not**
- Therapy
- Coaching
- Mediation
- Performance management
- Training people to behave differently
- An AI system making decisions

---

## 4. THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES (BUYER-SAFE)

> "Most harm in care, education, and community settings doesn't come from bad intent.  
> It comes from pressure, misalignment, and decisions made too quickly with partial understanding."

Common symptoms buyers recognise:
- Escalations that feel avoidable in hindsight
- ND people feeling misunderstood or sidelined
- Staff burnout despite good intentions
- Leaders forced to decide with incomplete clarity
- Reviews that explain what happened, but don't prevent recurrence

Shared Reality intervenes *before* those outcomes.

---

## 5. WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS (PLAIN LANGUAGE)

During a Shared Reality session:
- People describe the same situation from their perspective
- Differences are surfaced safely
- Pressure points are named
- No one is asked to defend themselves
- No one is forced to agree
- The group leaves with clearer understanding and safer next steps

Nothing is recorded that can be used against individuals.

---

## 6. WHY ND COMMUNITIES CARE

Shared Reality:
- Slows conversations that usually move too fast
- Makes space for different communication styles
- Separates behaviour from intent
- Prevents ND people being labelled instead of understood
- Reduces "why didn't they just…" narratives

It does not ask ND people to adapt to broken systems.
It adapts the system.

---

## 7. WHY LEADERS CARE

Shared Reality:
- Improves decision quality under pressure
- Reduces escalation and complaint risk
- Surfaces issues earlier
- Protects staff wellbeing
- Builds trust across boundaries

Leaders gain clarity — without becoming the arbiter of truth.

---

## 8. WHY COMMISSIONERS CARE

Shared Reality:
- Is preventative, not reactive
- Reduces downstream cost of escalation
- Improves outcomes without new services
- Strengthens existing teams
- Produces defensible learning without blame

It is low-burden, low-risk, and proportionate.

---

## 9. HOW IT IS SOLD (ETHICAL CONSTRAINTS)

Shared Reality must never be sold as:
- A fix for individuals
- A way to "manage difficult people"
- A compliance requirement
- A surveillance mechanism
- A performance intervention

If buyers ask for those things, the programme is not a fit.

---

## 10. COMMON QUESTIONS (SAFE ANSWERS)

**"Is this therapy?"**  
No. It's about understanding situations, not treating people.

**"Is this training?"**  
No. It's live sense-making around real situations.

**"Is this an AI product?"**  
No. Any AI is background support only. Humans lead.

**"Will this slow us down?"**  
It slows the moment — to prevent much bigger delays later.

**"What if people disagree?"**  
Agreement isn't required. Understanding is.
