# Shared Reality Programme — Block 1
## Project Scope & Foundation

---

## PRIMARY PURPOSE

Build a human-first system that helps people with shared responsibility but different experiences understand the same situation well enough to act without accidental harm.

**This is NOT:**
- AI therapy
- ND "training" alone
- Compliance or safeguarding theatre
- Abstract governance frameworks

**This IS:**
- Practical shared understanding
- Pressure-aware communication
- Decision clarity in care contexts
- Reduction of unintended harm caused by misalignment

---

## CORE BUYERS / COMMISSIONERS

- Social enterprises (e.g. Platfform)
- NHS-adjacent & community health orgs
- Local authorities / commissioners
- Schools & education trusts
- Charities & NGOs (incl. Christie's-style orgs)
- ND advocacy & support organisations

**They buy because:**
- Staff burnout
- Miscommunication
- ND harm without intent
- Risk escalation
- Safeguarding incidents
- Poor cross-role alignment

---

## PRIMARY AUDIENCES (END USERS)

1. **Frontline practitioners**
   - Support workers
   - Teachers
   - Clinicians
   - Social workers

2. **ND people & lived-experience contributors**
   - Neurodivergent adults & young people
   - Families / carers

3. **Leaders & decision-makers**
   - Service managers
   - Trustees
   - Commissioners
   - Policy leads

4. **Cross-boundary stakeholders**
   - Health ↔ education
   - Care ↔ housing
   - Charity ↔ public sector

## CORE OFFER

**Name (working):** SHARED REALITY PROGRAMME

**Simple explanation (public-facing):**
"We help people who work together see the same situation clearly — especially when stress, difference, and responsibility collide."

---

## WHAT WE DELIVER (PLAIN LANGUAGE)

1. **Shared Reality Sessions**
   - Facilitated conversations
   - Everyone names what they see, feel, and carry
   - No blame, no diagnosis, no hierarchy
   - Focus: "What's actually happening here?"

2. **Pressure Mapping (light, non-technical)**
   - What pressures are shaping behaviour?
   - What's invisible to others?
   - Where misunderstanding is likely

3. **ND-Aware Sense-Making**
   - Translate experiences without forcing sameness
   - Reduce burden on ND people to "explain themselves"
   - Make difference legible, not problematic

4. **Decision Moments Support**
   - Help teams pause at high-risk moments
   - Clarify what matters before action
   - Prevent escalation and accidental harm

---

## ROLE OF AI (BACKSTAGE ONLY)

**AI is used internally to:**
- Structure reflections
- Generate shared language drafts
- Create summaries & materials
- Support facilitators

**AI is NEVER:**
- A decision-maker
- A therapist
- A frontline interface
- A replacement for human judgment

**Public message:**
"Technology supports the work — humans do it."

---

## FORMAT & DELIVERY

- Short pilots (3–6 weeks)
- Workshops (in-person / hybrid)
- Train-the-facilitator model
- Simple written artefacts:
  - Shared understanding notes
  - Pressure maps
  - Alignment summaries

---

## OUTCOMES (WHAT BUYERS CARE ABOUT)

- Reduced conflict & escalation
- Improved staff confidence
- ND experiences better understood
- Fewer safeguarding incidents
- Clearer decisions under pressure
- Better cross-team trust

---

## WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT

- Not training → sense-making
- Not awareness → alignment
- Not diagnosis → understanding
- Not AI-led → human-led
- Not abstract → immediately usable

---

## NEXT BUILD STEPS

- BLOCK 2: Naming & narrative (public-safe language)
- BLOCK 3: Pilot structure (Platfform-ready)
- BLOCK 4: ND-specific adaptations (AP Cymru)
- BLOCK 5: Simple website & materials
- BLOCK 6: Funding & commissioning framing
