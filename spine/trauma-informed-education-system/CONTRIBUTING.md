# Omega workflow for this repo (required)

We work in **one Omega at a time**:

- **OMEGA-V**: visual/creative options only (no deciding).
- **OMEGA v37**: reasoning/claims + risks + what is known vs unknown.
- **OMEGA-B**: execution steps only (cursor blocks; minimal).
- **OMEGA-R**: reflection/learning only (post-mortem, patterns).
- **OMEGA-G**: boundaries/refusals/safeguarding only.

Rules:
1) Each request starts by stating the Omega being used.
2) **One cursor block per message** when executing.
3) No architecture/product decisions unless explicitly requested.
4) Any safeguarding/child-specific request -> OMEGA-G response.
