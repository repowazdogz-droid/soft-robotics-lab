# Stewardship

## Purpose

This document defines stewardship vs ownership, founder role over time, how decisions are made about changes, who can contribute, what will never change, and how the system resists trend-chasing and moral panic.

## Stewardship vs Ownership (System Is Cared For, Not Controlled)

### What Stewardship Means

**Stewardship:** Taking care of something for the benefit of others. The system is cared for, not controlled.

**Not ownership:** The system is not owned or controlled. It is stewarded for the benefit of schools and children.

**Purpose:** Stewardship supports quality and integrity, not control or dependency.

---

### What This Means in Practice

**Stewardship involves:**
- Caring for system integrity and quality
- Protecting principles and frameworks
- Supporting schools in using the system
- Maintaining boundaries and safeguards

**Stewardship does NOT involve:**
- Controlling how schools use the system
- Requiring compliance or fidelity
- Creating dependency or hierarchy
- Owning or controlling practice

---

### Why Stewardship Matters

**Sustainability:** Stewardship supports sustainability. Ownership creates dependency.

**Autonomy:** Stewardship supports autonomy. Ownership creates control.

**Integrity:** Stewardship protects integrity. Ownership can compromise integrity.

---

## Founder Role Over Time (Can Step Back Without Collapse)

### Founder Role Initially

**Initial role:** Founder creates and establishes the system, defines principles and frameworks, and sets boundaries.

**What this involves:**
- Creating foundational materials
- Defining principles and frameworks
- Establishing boundaries and safeguards
- Supporting initial implementation

**Why:** Initial role establishes the system and ensures quality and integrity.

---

### Founder Role Over Time

**Evolving role:** Founder role evolves from creation to stewardship. Founder can step back without collapse.

**What this means:**
- System works independently
- Founder presence not required
- Stewardship can be shared or transferred
- System survives founder absence

**Why:** System independence protects schools from founder dependency.

---

### Founder Can Step Back

**Stepping back:** Founder can step back, reduce involvement, or disappear without system collapse.

**What this means:**
- System works without founder
- Schools use system independently
- Stewardship can continue without founder
- System survives founder absence

**Why:** System independence protects schools and enables sustainability.

## How Decisions Are Made About Changes (Slow, Conservative, Documented)

### Decision-Making Principles

**Slow:** Decisions are made slowly, not quickly or reactively.

**Conservative:** Decisions are conservative, not radical or trend-driven.

**Documented:** All decisions are documented, explained, and transparent.

**Why:** Slow, conservative, documented decisions protect system integrity and prevent disruption.

---

### Decision-Making Process

**Process:**
1. Identify need or issue
2. Consider principles and frameworks
3. Evaluate impact and risks
4. Make slow, conservative decision
5. Document decision and rationale
6. Communicate clearly

**Why:** Structured process protects system integrity and prevents reactive changes.

---

### What Triggers Decisions

**Triggers:**
- Fundamental issues or problems
- Significant gaps or needs
- Clear evidence of harm or risk
- Major structural or architectural needs

**Does NOT trigger:**
- Trends or fads
- Pressure or demands
- New research (unless fundamental)
- Moral panic or reactive responses

**Why:** Decisions are driven by need, not trends or pressure.

---

## Who Can Contribute and How (Without Diluting Integrity)

### Who Can Contribute

**Contributors:** Anyone can contribute ideas, feedback, or suggestions.

**What this means:**
- Contributions are welcome
- Multiple perspectives are valued
- Feedback informs decisions
- Ideas are considered

**Why:** Contributions support learning and improvement without diluting integrity.

---

### How Contributions Work

**Contribution process:**
1. Submit idea, feedback, or suggestion
2. Contribution is considered against principles
3. Decision is made slowly and conservatively
4. Contribution is accepted, rejected, or adapted
5. Decision is documented and explained

**Why:** Structured process protects integrity while allowing contributions.

---

### Protecting Integrity

**Integrity protection:**
- Contributions must align with principles
- Changes must maintain boundaries
- Decisions protect system integrity
- No dilution or compromise

**Why:** Integrity protection ensures system remains safe, appropriate, and effective.

---

## What Will NEVER Change (Non-Negotiables)

### Core Principles

**Non-negotiable:** Core principles will never change fundamentally.

**What this means:**
- Principles remain stable
- No fundamental shifts or reversals
- Principles inform all decisions
- Principles protect system integrity

**Why:** Stable principles protect system integrity and prevent drift.

---

### Boundaries

**Non-negotiable:** Boundaries will never be removed or weakened.

**What this means:**
- Safeguarding boundaries remain
- Governance boundaries remain
- Refusal boundaries remain
- Ethical boundaries remain

**Why:** Boundaries protect schools, staff, and children. They cannot be compromised.

---

### Evidence Discipline

**Non-negotiable:** Evidence discipline will never be weakened or removed.

**What this means:**
- No outcome guarantees
- No causal language
- No predictive claims
- No efficacy claims

**Why:** Evidence discipline protects schools from overclaiming and false expectations.

---

### System Independence

**Non-negotiable:** System independence will never be compromised.

**What this means:**
- System works without founder
- Schools use system independently
- No dependency or control
- No forced changes or updates

**Why:** System independence protects schools and enables sustainability.

## How the System Resists Trend-Chasing and Moral Panic

### Trend-Chasing Resistance

**Resistance:** System resists trend-chasing and fads.

**How:**
- Decisions are slow and conservative
- Principles remain stable
- Changes are rare and significant
- No reactive updates or changes

**Why:** Trend-chasing creates disruption and instability. Resistance protects system integrity.

---

### Moral Panic Resistance

**Resistance:** System resists moral panic and reactive responses.

**How:**
- Decisions are slow and conservative
- Principles remain stable
- Changes are rare and significant
- No reactive updates or changes

**Why:** Moral panic creates disruption and instability. Resistance protects system integrity.

---

### How Resistance Works

**Resistance mechanisms:**
- Slow, conservative decision-making
- Stable principles and frameworks
- Rare, significant changes only
- Clear boundaries and safeguards

**Why:** Resistance mechanisms protect system integrity and prevent reactive changes.
