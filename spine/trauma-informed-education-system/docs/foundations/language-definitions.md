# Language Discipline & Definitions

## Purpose

Language shapes how we think, act, and respond. In schools, language is scrutinised. Misused terms create risk. This document governs all wording across the system.

This document defines approved terms, discouraged terms, and language rules. All materials, AI responses, and documentation must follow these rules.

---

## Why Language Matters

### Language Shapes Interpretation

The words we use shape how others interpret situations. "Dysregulated child" suggests a problem with the child. "Child experiencing stress" suggests a problem with the situation. Same child, different interpretation.

### Schools are Scrutinised Environments

Schools are inspected, reviewed, and scrutinised. Language that sounds clinical, diagnostic, or pathologising creates risk. Language that is clear, descriptive, and non-clinical is safer.

### Misused Terms Create Risk

Using clinical terms without clinical training creates risk. Using vague terms creates confusion. Using pathologising terms creates harm.

**Rule:** If you wouldn't say it in an inspection, don't say it in the system.

---

## Approved Terms

### Trauma-Informed

**Definition:** An approach that recognises the impact of stress and adversity on people and designs environments that reduce harm and increase safety.

**How to use:** "We use a trauma-informed approach" means we design environments with safety, predictability, and support in mind.

**What it does NOT mean:** It does not mean we diagnose trauma, treat trauma, or work with trauma directly.

---

### Regulation

**Definition:** The ability to manage emotions, energy, and attention in response to the demands of a situation.

**How to use:** "Supporting regulation" means helping someone manage their emotions, energy, and attention appropriately.

**What it does NOT mean:** It does not mean fixing someone or making them calm. It means supporting their capacity to manage themselves.

---

### Dysregulation

**Definition:** A temporary state where someone's capacity to manage emotions, energy, or attention is exceeded.

**How to use:** "A child experiencing dysregulation" means a child whose capacity to manage is temporarily exceeded.

**What it does NOT mean:** It does not mean the child is broken, disordered, or problematic. It means their capacity is temporarily exceeded.

**Important:** Use sparingly. Prefer "experiencing stress" or "overloaded" when possible.

---

### Co-Regulation

**Definition:** The process where one person's regulated state supports another person's regulation.

**How to use:** "Co-regulation" means adults using their own regulated state to support children's regulation.

**What it does NOT mean:** It does not mean fixing or controlling someone. It means being regulated yourself so others can regulate.

---

### Repair

**Definition:** The process of acknowledging harm, taking responsibility, and working together to restore relationship and trust.

**How to use:** "Repair" means fixing what went wrong, not just apologising.

**What it does NOT mean:** It does not mean punishment or consequences. It means restoration and learning.

---

### Safety

**Definition:** Feeling secure enough to learn, connect, and make mistakes without fear of harm, shame, or rejection.

**How to use:** "Creating safety" means creating conditions where people feel secure enough to engage.

**What it does NOT mean:** It does not mean removing all risk or challenge. It means reducing unnecessary harm and fear.

---

### Predictability

**Definition:** Consistency and clarity in routines, responses, and expectations that allow people to prepare and engage.

**How to use:** "Predictability" means consistency and clarity, not rigidity.

**What it does NOT mean:** It does not mean no flexibility or change. It means clear communication and consistent responses.

---

## Discouraged / Restricted Terms

### "Traumatised Child"

**Problem:** Sounds diagnostic and pathologising. Suggests the child is the problem.

**Alternative:** "Child experiencing stress" or "Child who has experienced adversity"

**Rule:** Never use "traumatised" as a label for a child.

---

### "Triggered"

**Problem:** Overused and clinical-sounding. Often used incorrectly.

**Alternative:** "Overloaded," "stressed," "overwhelmed," or "activated"

**Rule:** Avoid "triggered" unless you mean a specific, known trigger. Prefer descriptive language.

---

### "Fight/Flight"

**Problem:** Overly clinical and can sound pathologising. Often misunderstood.

**Alternative:** "Protective response," "stress response," or "survival response"

**Rule:** Avoid clinical terms. Use plain language that describes what's happening.

---

### "Meltdown"

**Problem:** Can sound dismissive or pathologising. Often used to describe normal stress responses.

**Alternative:** "Loss of regulation," "overwhelmed," or "unable to manage"

**Rule:** Use descriptive language that explains what's happening, not labels that judge.

---

### "Behaviour Management"

**Problem:** Suggests controlling behaviour rather than understanding need.

**Alternative:** "Supporting regulation," "responding to need," or "creating conditions for success"

**Rule:** Focus on support and understanding, not management and control.

---

### "Attention-Seeking"

**Problem:** Dismissive and judgmental. All behaviour seeks connection.

**Alternative:** "Seeking connection," "needing support," or "communicating need"

**Rule:** Recognise that all behaviour communicates need. Avoid dismissive labels.

---

## AI Language Rules

### No Diagnostic Labels

**Rule:** AI must never use diagnostic labels (ADHD, autism, trauma, etc.) unless explicitly provided by a professional.

**Example:** Instead of "This child may have ADHD," say "This child may benefit from movement breaks."

---

### No Causal Claims

**Rule:** AI must never claim that one thing causes another without evidence.

**Example:** Instead of "Trauma causes dysregulation," say "Stress can affect regulation."

---

### No Predictive Statements

**Rule:** AI must never predict outcomes or make claims about the future.

**Example:** Instead of "This will help the child," say "This may support the child."

---

### Always Provisional, Reflective Phrasing

**Rule:** AI must use provisional, reflective language that invites thinking, not directives.

**Example:** Instead of "You should do X," say "You might consider X" or "Some people find X helpful."

---

### Always Non-Pathologising

**Rule:** AI must never pathologise behaviour, children, or adults.

**Example:** Instead of "The child is dysregulated," say "The child appears to be experiencing stress."

---

### Always Non-Directive

**Rule:** AI must support reflection and decision-making, not provide directives.

**Example:** Instead of "Do this," say "You might consider this" or "Some options include..."

---

## Inspection-Safe Language Check

Before using any language in materials, AI responses, or documentation, check:

- [ ] Would I be comfortable saying this in an inspection?
- [ ] Does this sound clinical or diagnostic?
- [ ] Does this pathologise anyone?
- [ ] Is this clear and descriptive?
- [ ] Does this use approved terms?
- [ ] Does this avoid discouraged terms?
- [ ] Is this non-directive and reflective?
- [ ] Does this invite thinking, not compliance?

If any answer is "no," revise the language.

## Language Examples

### ❌ Unsafe Language

- "The traumatised child is triggered and having a meltdown."
- "This child needs behaviour management."
- "Trauma causes dysregulation."
- "You should use this technique."

### ✅ Safe Language

- "The child appears to be experiencing stress and is overwhelmed."
- "This child may benefit from support with regulation."
- "Stress can affect regulation."
- "You might consider this approach, or adapt it to your context."
