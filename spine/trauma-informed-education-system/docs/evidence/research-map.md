# Research Map

## Purpose

This document maps the major research domains that inform the trauma-informed education system. It shows intellectual grounding without claiming efficacy. It clarifies what the system draws from each domain and what it explicitly does not claim.

**Important:** This is not an evidence-based intervention; it is an evidence-informed framework. The system draws on research to inform principles and practice, but it does not claim research-proven outcomes.

---

## Trauma-Informed Education

### What This System Draws From

**Principles:** The system draws on principles from trauma-informed education research, including:
- Recognition that stress and adversity affect learning and regulation
- Understanding that environments matter more than individual characteristics
- Focus on creating safety, predictability, and support
- Emphasis on adult capacity and regulation

**Frameworks:** The system uses frameworks from trauma-informed education that focus on:
- System design rather than individual intervention
- Environmental conditions rather than child characteristics
- Adult support rather than child treatment
- Prevention rather than remediation

---

### What This System Does NOT Claim

**Does NOT claim:**
- That trauma-informed education research proves this system works
- That this system is an evidence-based intervention
- That research shows specific outcomes from this system
- That this system replicates research-proven interventions
- That research validates this specific approach

**Why:** Research informs principles and frameworks, but this system is not a research-proven intervention. It is an evidence-informed framework that schools adapt to their context.

## Attachment & Relational Safety (Non-Clinical Framing)

### What This System Draws From

**Principles:** The system draws on principles from attachment and relational safety research, including:
- Recognition that relationships matter for learning and regulation
- Understanding that consistent, attuned responses build safety
- Focus on repair when relationships rupture
- Emphasis on adult capacity to create safety

**Frameworks:** The system uses frameworks that focus on:
- Relational safety in professional contexts, not clinical attachment
- Consistent, predictable responses, not therapeutic interventions
- Repair processes, not attachment therapy
- Adult capacity, not child attachment assessment

---

### What This System Does NOT Claim

**Does NOT claim:**
- That this system provides attachment therapy or interventions
- That this system assesses or diagnoses attachment
- That this system replicates attachment research interventions
- That research proves this system improves attachment
- That this system is based on attachment therapy

**Why:** The system draws on relational safety principles, but it does not provide attachment therapy or clinical interventions. It focuses on creating safe, consistent relationships in professional contexts.

---

## Stress & Regulation (Adult-Focused)

### What This System Draws From

**Principles:** The system draws on principles from stress and regulation research, including:
- Recognition that stress affects regulation and learning
- Understanding that adult regulation supports child regulation
- Focus on reducing stress load, not just teaching techniques
- Emphasis on system support for regulation

**Frameworks:** The system uses frameworks that focus on:
- Adult regulation as the primary lever
- Stress load reduction, not just skill development
- System support for regulation, not individual responsibility
- Environmental conditions that support regulation

---

### What This System Does NOT Claim

**Does NOT claim:**
- That this system provides regulation therapy or interventions
- That this system assesses or diagnoses regulation
- That research proves this system improves regulation
- That this system replicates regulation research interventions
- That this system is based on regulation therapy

**Why:** The system draws on regulation principles, but it does not provide regulation therapy or clinical interventions. It focuses on supporting adult regulation and creating conditions that support regulation.

---

## Systems Change in Schools

### What This System Draws From

**Principles:** The system draws on principles from systems change research, including:
- Recognition that systems matter more than individuals
- Understanding that change requires system-level shifts
- Focus on system design rather than individual intervention
- Emphasis on sustainability and capacity

**Frameworks:** The system uses frameworks that focus on:
- System design decisions
- Resource allocation
- Process improvement
- Capacity building

---

### What This System Does NOT Claim

**Does NOT claim:**
- That research proves this system creates systems change
- That this system replicates research-proven systems change interventions
- That research shows specific systems change outcomes
- That this system is an evidence-based systems change programme
- That research validates this specific systems change approach

**Why:** Research informs systems change principles, but this system is not a research-proven systems change intervention. It is an evidence-informed framework that schools adapt to their context.

---

## Implementation Science (Why Programmes Fail)

### What This System Draws From

**Principles:** The system draws on principles from implementation science, including:
- Recognition that programmes often fail due to implementation issues
- Understanding that adoption matters more than compliance
- Focus on local adaptation rather than fidelity
- Emphasis on capacity and sustainability

**Frameworks:** The system uses frameworks that focus on:
- Avoiding programme failure patterns
- Supporting adoption rather than compliance
- Allowing local adaptation
- Building capacity and sustainability

---

### What This System Does NOT Claim

**Does NOT claim:**
- That research proves this system avoids programme failure
- That this system is research-proven to succeed where others fail
- That research shows this system has better implementation outcomes
- That this system is an evidence-based implementation approach
- That research validates this specific implementation strategy

**Why:** Research informs implementation principles, but this system is not a research-proven implementation intervention. It is an evidence-informed framework that schools adapt to their context.

---

## How Research Informs This System

### Research as Foundation, Not Proof

**Research informs:** Research provides principles, frameworks, and understanding that inform the system's design and practice.

**Research does NOT prove:** Research does not prove that this specific system works or produces specific outcomes.

**Research supports:** Research supports the principles and frameworks used in the system, but it does not validate the system itself.

---

### Evidence-Informed, Not Evidence-Based

**Evidence-informed:** The system is informed by evidence and research, drawing on principles and frameworks from multiple domains.

**Not evidence-based:** The system is not an evidence-based intervention with research-proven outcomes.

**Framework, not intervention:** The system is a framework that schools adapt, not a fixed intervention with proven outcomes.

---

## What Research Does NOT Tell Us

### Research Does NOT Tell Us

**Research does NOT tell us:**
- That this specific system works
- That this system produces specific outcomes
- That this system is better than other approaches
- That this system is appropriate for all schools
- That this system will work in your context

**Why:** Research informs principles and frameworks, but it does not validate specific systems or predict outcomes in specific contexts.

---

### What We Do NOT Know

**We do NOT know:**
- Whether this system will work in your school
- What outcomes this system will produce
- How this system compares to other approaches
- Whether this system is appropriate for your context
- What will happen if you use this system

**Why:** Outcomes vary based on many factors. Research cannot predict outcomes in specific contexts.

---

## Research Limitations

### Research Context

**Research context:** Research is conducted in specific contexts with specific conditions. Results may not apply to other contexts.

**Research limitations:** Research has limitations, including:
- Context-specific results
- Limited generalisability
- Varied outcomes
- Multiple factors affecting results

**Why this matters:** Research informs but does not guarantee. Context matters. Outcomes vary.

---

### Research and Practice

**Research informs practice:** Research provides principles and frameworks that inform practice.

**Practice adapts research:** Practice adapts research principles to local contexts and conditions.

**Practice learns from experience:** Practice learns from experience, not just research.

**Why this matters:** Research informs, but practice adapts and learns. This system supports practice, not research replication.
