# Certification

## Purpose

This document defines certification as stewardship, not accreditation. It clarifies what certification means, who can be certified, renewal principles, anti-gatekeeping rules, and how certification avoids creating dependency or hierarchy.

**Note:** Certification is excluded from V1 MVP. This document defines the approach for future consideration.

## Certification as Stewardship, Not Accreditation

### What Stewardship Means

**Stewardship:** Taking care of something for the benefit of others. Certification as stewardship means taking care of trauma-informed practice for the benefit of schools and children.

**Not accreditation:** Certification is not accreditation, validation, or approval. It's recognition of commitment to trauma-informed principles and practice.

**Purpose:** Stewardship supports quality and integrity, not gatekeeping or hierarchy.

---

### What This Means in Practice

**Certification recognises:**
- Commitment to trauma-informed principles
- Understanding of frameworks and processes
- Application of principles in practice
- Ongoing learning and reflection

**Certification does NOT:**
- Validate or approve practice
- Create hierarchy or status
- Gatekeep or exclude
- Require perfection or compliance

---

## What Certification Means (And Does NOT Mean)

### What Certification Means

**Recognition:** Certification recognises commitment to trauma-informed principles and practice.

**Stewardship:** Certification recognises stewardship of trauma-informed practice in your context.

**Learning:** Certification recognises ongoing learning and reflection.

**Application:** Certification recognises application of principles in practice.

---

### What Certification Does NOT Mean

**Does NOT mean:**
- That practice is perfect or validated
- That outcomes are guaranteed
- That you are an expert or authority
- That you can certify others
- That you have special status or privilege

**Why:** Certification recognises commitment and stewardship, not perfection or authority.

---

## Who Can Be Certified

### Individuals

**Who:** Individual staff members (teachers, leaders, support staff) who demonstrate commitment to trauma-informed principles and practice.

**What it means:** Recognition of individual commitment and stewardship.

**What it does NOT mean:** Special status, authority, or expertise.

---

### Schools

**Who:** Schools that demonstrate commitment to trauma-informed principles and system design.

**What it means:** Recognition of school-wide commitment and stewardship.

**What it does NOT mean:** Validation, approval, or special status.

---

### Systems

**Who:** Systems (trusts, authorities, networks) that demonstrate commitment to trauma-informed principles across multiple schools.

**What it means:** Recognition of system-wide commitment and stewardship.

**What it does NOT mean:** Validation, approval, or special status.

---

## Renewal Principles (Light-Touch, Reflection-Based, Non-Punitive)

### Light-Touch Renewal

**Renewal process:** Simple, light-touch renewal that doesn't create burden or dependency.

**What this means:**
- Brief reflection on practice
- Recognition of ongoing learning
- No extensive documentation
- No performance evaluation

**Why:** Light-touch renewal supports ongoing commitment without creating burden.

---

### Reflection-Based Renewal

**Renewal focus:** Reflection on practice, learning, and application of principles.

**What this means:**
- Brief reflection prompts
- Consideration of learning and growth
- Recognition of challenges and adaptations
- No performance evaluation

**Why:** Reflection supports learning and commitment, not compliance or performance.

---

### Non-Punitive Renewal

**Renewal approach:** Supportive, not punitive. Learning-focused, not compliance-focused.

**What this means:**
- No penalties for challenges or mistakes
- Support for learning and growth
- Recognition that practice evolves
- No loss of certification for learning

**Why:** Non-punitive renewal supports learning and growth, not compliance or perfection.

---

## Anti-Gatekeeping Rules

### No Gatekeeping

**Rule:** Certification does not gatekeep or exclude. It recognises commitment, not perfection.

**What this means:**
- Certification is accessible, not exclusive
- Multiple pathways to certification
- No arbitrary barriers or requirements
- Support for all who seek certification

**Why:** Gatekeeping creates hierarchy and exclusion. Certification should support, not exclude.

---

### No Hierarchy

**Rule:** Certification does not create hierarchy or status differences.

**What this means:**
- Certified and non-certified are equal
- Certification doesn't confer authority
- No special privileges or status
- No hierarchy between certified individuals

**Why:** Hierarchy creates division and dependency. Certification should support, not divide.

---

### No Exclusion

**Rule:** Certification does not exclude or create barriers.

**What this means:**
- Multiple pathways to certification
- Support for all who seek certification
- No arbitrary requirements or barriers
- Accessible and inclusive process

**Why:** Exclusion creates division and dependency. Certification should be accessible and inclusive.

---

## How Certification Avoids Creating Dependency or Hierarchy

### No Dependency

**Certification does NOT create:**
- Dependency on certifying body
- Dependency on founder or system creator
- Dependency on ongoing approval or validation
- Dependency on certification renewal

**How this is ensured:**
- Certification is recognition, not requirement
- Practice continues with or without certification
- No dependency on certifying body for practice
- Certification supports, not controls

---

### No Hierarchy

**Certification does NOT create:**
- Hierarchy between certified and non-certified
- Hierarchy between certification levels
- Special status or privileges
- Authority or expertise claims

**How this is ensured:**
- Certification is recognition, not status
- All practitioners are equal
- No special privileges or authority
- Certification supports, not divides

---

### No Control

**Certification does NOT:**
- Control or regulate practice
- Require compliance or fidelity
- Enforce standards or requirements
- Create dependency on certifying body

**How this is ensured:**
- Certification recognises, not regulates
- Practice is autonomous and adaptable
- No compliance or fidelity requirements
- Certification supports, not controls

---
