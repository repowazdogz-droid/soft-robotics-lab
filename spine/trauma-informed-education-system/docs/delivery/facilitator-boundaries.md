# Facilitator Boundaries

## Purpose

This document provides clear boundaries and scripts for facilitators (whether internal staff or external providers) when delivering trauma-informed education modules. These boundaries protect everyone and prevent therapeutic drift.

---

## Disclosure Response Script (Contain + Redirect)

### When Staff Share Personal Experiences

**If someone shares personal trauma or difficult experiences:**

**Response:** "Thank you for sharing. I want to acknowledge that this is important, and I also want to protect your privacy and boundaries. This session focuses on professional practice, not personal experience. If you'd like support with personal experiences, I can provide information about appropriate professional support."

**Why:** Personal disclosure creates risk and is not necessary for learning trauma-informed practice. Redirecting protects privacy and maintains professional boundaries.

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't explore personal experiences
- Don't provide therapy or counselling
- Don't ask follow-up questions about personal experiences
- Don't share your own personal experiences
- Don't create group sharing about personal experiences

---

### When Staff Ask for Personal Advice

**If someone asks for advice about their own trauma or experiences:**

**Response:** "I appreciate that you're asking, but I'm not qualified to provide personal advice or support. This session focuses on professional practice. If you'd like support with personal experiences, I can provide information about appropriate professional support."

**Why:** Personal advice requires professional training and appropriate boundaries. Redirecting protects everyone and maintains boundaries.

## "Advice About a Child" Refusal Language

### When Staff Ask for Clinical Advice About a Child

**If someone asks for clinical assessment, diagnosis, or therapeutic advice about a child:**

**Response:** "I can't provide clinical assessment or therapeutic advice. That requires appropriate professional training and assessment. This session focuses on creating supportive environments and responding to need. If you have concerns about a child, I'd encourage you to follow your school's safeguarding procedures and consult with appropriate professionals."

**Why:** Clinical advice requires professional training and appropriate assessment. Providing it without training creates risk and harm.

**What to do instead:**
- Support staff to follow safeguarding procedures
- Help staff understand trauma-informed principles
- Guide staff to appropriate professional support
- Focus on system support, not individual diagnosis

---

### When Staff Ask "What Should I Do About This Child?"

**If someone asks for specific advice about a child:**

**Response:** "I can't provide specific advice about individual children without proper assessment and context. What I can do is help you think through trauma-informed principles and processes that might apply. Let's consider: What need might be communicated? How can you create safety and predictability? What support might be needed? And remember to follow your safeguarding procedures."

**Why:** Specific advice about individual children requires assessment and context. Providing it without these creates risk.

**What to do instead:**
- Help staff apply principles and processes
- Support staff to consider context and need
- Guide staff to appropriate professional support
- Focus on system support, not individual fixes

## Stop-Session Criteria

### Stop the Session If:

**Emotional distress:** If someone becomes emotionally distressed and cannot continue safely.

**Response:** "I notice that this is difficult. Let's pause. Your wellbeing matters. Would you like to take a break, or would you prefer to stop? There's no pressure to continue."

**Safeguarding concerns:** If safeguarding concerns arise during the session.

**Response:** "I need to pause here. If you have safeguarding concerns, we need to follow safeguarding procedures. Let's connect with [designated safeguarding lead]."

**Boundary violations:** If boundaries are being crossed or violated.

**Response:** "I need to pause here. We need to maintain professional boundaries. Let's clarify boundaries before continuing."

**Therapeutic drift:** If the session drifts into therapy or personal counselling.

**Response:** "I need to pause here. This session focuses on professional practice, not personal therapy. Let's refocus on trauma-informed principles and practice."

**Capacity exceeded:** If staff are clearly overwhelmed or exhausted.

**Response:** "I notice that this might be too much right now. Let's pause. There's no pressure to continue. We can resume when it's appropriate."
