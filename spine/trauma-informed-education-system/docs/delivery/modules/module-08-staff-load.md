- Read operating assumptions about adults
- Understand capacity and stress load
- Review strategies for reducing load
- Understand system support for capacity
- Review time protection rules

**Reflection and application (20 minutes):**
- Optional reflection on capacity
- Consider strategies and system support
- Plan one small change
- No personal disclosure required

## Optional Activities

### Activity 1: Capacity Self-Assessment (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Notice your own capacity patterns

**Task:** Reflect on your capacity patterns (optional, no sharing required).

**Questions to consider:**
- What affects your capacity?
- How do you notice when capacity is exceeded?
- What increases your stress load?
- What reduces your stress load?

**Guidelines:**
- Personal reflection only
- No pressure to share
- Focus on practical strategies
- No personal disclosure required

---

### Activity 2: Load Reduction Planning (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Plan how to reduce stress load

**Task:** Consider what creates stress load and how to reduce it.

**Questions to consider:**
- What creates stress load for you?
- What can be reduced or simplified?
- What support do you need?
- How can systems support you?

**Guidelines:**
- Focus on practical strategies
- Consider system support
- No personal disclosure required

---

### Activity 3: System Support Planning (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Plan how systems can support capacity

**Task:** Consider how systems can reduce stress load and support capacity.

**Questions to consider:**
- How can systems reduce stress load?
- What resources support capacity?
- What processes protect capacity?
- How can leaders support capacity?

**Guidelines:**
- Focus on systems, not individuals
- Consider practical constraints
- No personal disclosure required

## Common Misuse Patterns + Redirection

### Misuse: Individual Responsibility Only

**Pattern:** Expecting individuals to manage capacity without systemic support.

**Redirection:** Systems must support capacity. Leaders create conditions. Individuals manage capacity within supportive systems.

---

### Misuse: Blame for Capacity Limits

**Pattern:** Blaming individuals when capacity is exceeded.

**Redirection:** Capacity limits are normal, not failure. Support capacity. Reduce stress load. Create systems that protect capacity.

---

### Misuse: Perfectionism

**Pattern:** Expecting unlimited capacity or perfect performance.

**Redirection:** Capacity is finite and varies. Support capacity. Recognise limits. Protect capacity where possible.

---

### Misuse: Adding Without Removing

**Pattern:** Adding new demands without reducing existing demands.

**Redirection:** Remove before adding. Protect capacity. Reduce stress load. Don't add without removing.

## What This Module Does NOT Do

- Does NOT provide individual therapy
- Does NOT require personal disclosure or sharing
- Does NOT provide clinical assessment
- Does NOT teach therapeutic techniques
- Does NOT promise specific outcomes
- Does NOT replace professional support

## Safeguarding & Boundary Note

This module supports staff capacity. It does NOT replace safeguarding training or procedures. If you have safeguarding concerns, follow your school's safeguarding procedures immediately. Protecting staff capacity supports safeguarding by helping staff respond appropriately, but it does NOT replace safeguarding protocols or professional responsibilities. Always follow safeguarding procedures first.
