45–60 minutes (flexible based on available time)

## What Participants Should Leave With

- Framework for system design decisions
- Understanding of key system decisions that matter most
- How to support adult regulation
- How to create predictability
- How to allocate resources effectively
- Clear boundaries about leadership responsibilities

- No personal disclosure required

### 60-Minute Variant

**Reading and orientation (35 minutes):**
- Read role translations for leadership
- Review pillars framework
- Understand system design principles
- Review process maps overview
- Review implementation cycles

**Reflection and planning (25 minutes):**
- Optional reflection on current systems
- Consider system decisions
- Plan one system change
- No personal disclosure required

## Optional Activities

### Activity 1: System Decision Framework (15 minutes)

**Purpose:** Apply system design framework to a current decision

**Task:** Choose a current system decision and consider it through the lens of trauma-informed principles.

**Questions to consider:**
- Does this support adult regulation?
- Does this increase predictability?
- Does this support relational safety?
- Does this enable repair and learning?

**Guidelines:**
- Focus on systems, not individuals
- Consider practical implications
- No personal disclosure required

---

### Activity 2: Resource Allocation Reflection (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Consider how resources support trauma-informed practice

**Task:** Review current resource allocation and consider how it supports or hinders trauma-informed practice.

**Questions to consider:**
- What resources support adult regulation?
- What resources create predictability?
- What resources enable repair and learning?
- What might need to change?

**Guidelines:**
- Focus on systems and resources
- Consider practical constraints
- No personal disclosure required

---

### Activity 3: Boundary Clarification (5 minutes)

**Purpose:** Understand leadership boundaries

**Task:** Review "What Leadership is NOT Expected to Do" and consider why these boundaries matter.

**Guidelines:**
- Focus on understanding boundaries
- Consider why boundaries protect everyone
- No personal disclosure required

## Common Misuse Patterns + Redirection

### Misuse: Pushing Responsibility Downstream

**Pattern:** Leaders expect teachers to implement trauma-informed practice without system support.

**Redirection:** Leaders design systems that enable practice. Support adults so adults can support children. Provide resources, time, and support.

---

### Misuse: Individual Case Management

**Pattern:** Leaders try to manage individual cases or provide therapeutic support.

**Redirection:** Leaders design systems. They ensure appropriate professionals handle individual cases. They support systems, not individuals.

---

### Misuse: Perfect Implementation Pressure

**Pattern:** Leaders pressure staff to implement perfectly or quickly.

**Redirection:** Leaders support gradual, sustainable implementation. They protect capacity and allow learning. They model principles consistently.

---

### Misuse: Resource Allocation Without Principles

**Pattern:** Leaders allocate resources without considering trauma-informed principles.

**Redirection:** Leaders allocate resources aligned with principles. They support adult regulation, create predictability, and enable repair.

## What This Module Does NOT Do

- Does NOT provide clinical expertise or training
- Does NOT teach therapeutic techniques
- Does NOT require personal disclosure or sharing
- Does NOT provide individual case management guidance
- Does NOT replace safeguarding training
- Does NOT promise specific outcomes
- Does NOT require perfect implementation

## Safeguarding & Boundary Note

This module supports system design. It does NOT replace safeguarding training or procedures. Leaders must ensure safeguarding procedures are followed. Trauma-informed systems support safeguarding by creating conditions that reduce harm and support appropriate responses, but they do NOT replace safeguarding protocols or professional responsibilities. Always follow safeguarding procedures first.
