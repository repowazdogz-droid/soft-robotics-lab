# Module 3: Creating Predictable Classroom Environments

## Purpose

This module supports teachers to create predictable, safe classroom environments. It focuses on routines, transitions, responses, and expectations that reduce stress and support learning.

## Intended Audience

Teachers and classroom staff

## Time Range

30–45 minutes (flexible based on available time)

## What Participants Should Leave With

- Practical guidance on routines, transitions, and responses
- How to balance predictability with flexibility
- Common failure modes and how to avoid them
- Simple processes for maintaining predictability
- Confidence to create predictable environments

## Session Shape

### 30-Minute Variant

**Reading and orientation (20 minutes):**
- Read pillar on predictable environments
- Review process maps for predictability
- Understand balance between predictability and flexibility

**Reflection and application (10 minutes):**
- Optional reflection on current routines
- Consider one small change
- No personal disclosure required

### 45-Minute Variant

**Reading and orientation (25 minutes):**
- Read pillar on predictable environments
- Review process maps for predictability
- Understand balance between predictability and flexibility
- Review common failure modes

**Reflection and application (20 minutes):**
- Optional reflection on current routines
- Consider practical applications
- Plan one small change
- No personal disclosure required

## Optional Activities

### Activity 1: Routine Audit (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Review current routines for predictability

**Task:** List your current classroom routines and consider their predictability.

**Questions to consider:**
- Are routines clear and consistent?
- Are transitions predictable?
- Are responses consistent?
- What might improve predictability?

**Guidelines:**
- Focus on routines, not individuals
- Consider practical constraints
- No personal disclosure required

---

### Activity 2: Transition Planning (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Plan predictable transitions

**Task:** Choose one transition and plan how to make it more predictable.

**Consider:**
- Advance notice
- Clear signals
- Consistent process
- Time for preparation

**Guidelines:**
- Focus on process, not behaviour
- Consider practical applications
- No personal disclosure required

---

### Activity 3: Response Consistency Check (5 minutes)

**Purpose:** Consider response consistency

**Task:** Reflect on how you respond to similar situations and consider consistency.

**Questions to consider:**
- Are responses consistent?
- Are principles clear?
- What might improve consistency?

**Guidelines:**
- Focus on responses, not individuals
- Consider principles, not scripts
- No personal disclosure required

## Common Misuse Patterns + Redirection

### Misuse: Over-Routinisation

**Pattern:** Creating so many routines that there's no flexibility or spontaneity.

**Redirection:** Balance predictability with flexibility. Routines provide structure, not rigidity. Allow exceptions when needed.

---

### Misuse: Inconsistent Communication

**Pattern:** Not communicating changes or expectations clearly.

**Redirection:** Communicate clearly and consistently. Provide advance notice when possible. Explain reasons for changes.

---

### Misuse: Perfectionism

**Pattern:** Expecting perfect consistency creates stress and reduces ability to adapt.

**Redirection:** Consistency matters more than perfection. Small inconsistencies are normal. Focus on principles, not perfection.

---

### Misuse: Individual Responsibility

**Pattern:** Expecting individuals to maintain predictability without systemic support.

**Redirection:** Systems support predictability. Leaders create conditions. Teachers implement within supportive systems.

## What This Module Does NOT Do

- Does NOT provide scripts to follow verbatim
- Does NOT provide behaviour management programmes
- Does NOT teach therapeutic techniques
- Does NOT require personal disclosure or sharing
- Does NOT promise specific outcomes
- Does NOT replace safeguarding training

## Safeguarding & Boundary Note

This module supports classroom practice. It does NOT replace safeguarding training or procedures. If you have safeguarding concerns, follow your school's safeguarding procedures immediately. Predictable environments support safeguarding by creating conditions that reduce harm and support appropriate responses, but they do NOT replace safeguarding protocols or professional responsibilities. Always follow safeguarding procedures first.
