## Optional Activities

### Activity 1: Response Planning (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Plan responses to stress scenarios

**Task:** Read a scenario and plan your response using the process.

**Example scenario:** "A child arrives at school clearly distressed and refuses to enter the classroom."

**Response planning:**
- Before: Notice your own state, consider context
- During: Attune, reduce demands, maintain safety, stay regulated
- After: Allow recovery, repair if needed, reflect, plan

**Guidelines:**
- Focus on process, not scripts
- Consider practical applications
- No personal disclosure required

---

### Activity 2: Attunement Practice (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Practice attuning to need, not controlling behaviour

**Task:** Read scenarios and consider what need might be communicated.

**Questions to consider:**
- What might this behaviour be communicating?
- What need might be unmet?
- How can I respond to need, not just behaviour?
- What context matters?

**Guidelines:**
- Focus on understanding, not fixing
- Consider context and systems
- No personal disclosure required

---

### Activity 3: Demand Reduction Planning (5 minutes)

**Purpose:** Plan how to reduce demands when children are stressed

**Task:** Consider how to reduce cognitive, emotional, or social demands.

**Questions to consider:**
- What demands can be reduced?
- How can I simplify the environment?
- What space might be needed?
- How can I support regulation?

**Guidelines:**
- Focus on practical strategies
- Consider context and safety
- No personal disclosure required

## Common Misuse Patterns + Redirection

### Misuse: Escalation

**Pattern:** Matching the child's energy or escalating the situation.

**Redirection:** Stay regulated. Your regulated state supports the child's regulation. Don't escalate.

---

### Misuse: Taking It Personally

**Pattern:** Taking the child's response personally.

**Redirection:** The child's response is about their need, not your failure. Don't take it personally. Focus on need.

---

### Misuse: Rushing

**Pattern:** Rushing to "fix" or "move on."

**Redirection:** Regulation takes time. Don't rush. Allow recovery time. Support regulation, don't force it.

---

### Misuse: Isolation

**Pattern:** Isolating the child unnecessarily.

**Redirection:** Support regulation while maintaining connection. Isolation increases stress. Connection supports regulation.

## Safeguarding & Boundary Note

This module supports response to stress. It does NOT replace safeguarding training or procedures. If you have safeguarding concerns, follow your school's safeguarding procedures immediately. Responding to stress supports safeguarding by helping staff recognise and respond to need appropriately, but it does NOT replace safeguarding protocols or professional responsibilities. Always follow safeguarding procedures first.
