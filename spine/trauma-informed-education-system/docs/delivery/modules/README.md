# Modular Delivery System (V1)

## Purpose

This document defines a modular, mix-and-match delivery system that works asynchronously, minimises founder time, is safe for schools, and can be licensed, repeated, and scaled.

---

## Why Modules (Not Courses)

### Courses Create Dependency and Drop-Off

Courses require attendance, completion, and follow-up. They create dependency on trainers, schedules, and resources. When courses end, engagement often drops. People complete courses but don't change practice.

### Modules Allow Selective Uptake

Modules allow schools to choose what they need, when they need it. Schools can select modules that fit their context, capacity, and priorities. This respects school autonomy and reduces dependency.

### Modules Respect Staff Time and Capacity

Modules are designed to fit into existing time structures. They don't require extensive time commitments or perfect conditions. They work with reality, not against it.

---

## Module Design Rules

### Max Time Per Module

**30–60 minutes maximum:** Each module should take no more than 30–60 minutes to complete. This includes reading, reflection, and application.

**Why:** Teachers and leaders are exhausted. Long modules don't get completed. Short modules are more likely to be used.

**Flexibility:** Modules can be completed in one sitting or broken into smaller chunks. They adapt to available time, not the other way around.

### No Emotional Disclosure Requirements

**No personal sharing:** Modules never require staff to share personal experiences, trauma history, or emotional disclosures.

**Why:** Emotional disclosure creates risk, discomfort, and potential harm. It's not necessary for learning trauma-informed practice.

**Alternative:** Modules use examples, scenarios, and reflection prompts that don't require personal disclosure.

### No Personal History Sharing

**No trauma history:** Modules never ask staff to share their own trauma history or experiences.

**Why:** Trauma history is personal and private. Sharing it in professional contexts creates risk and is not necessary for practice.

**Alternative:** Modules focus on understanding principles and applying them, not on personal experience.

### Standalone Usefulness

**Each module stands alone:** Each module provides value on its own, even if other modules aren't completed.

**Why:** Schools may not complete all modules. Each module should provide useful learning and practice guidance independently.

**Connection:** Modules connect to each other but don't depend on each other. They can be used in any order or combination.

## Optional vs Required Modules

### What Schools May Choose

**All modules are optional:** Schools choose which modules to use based on their context, capacity, and priorities.

**Recommended starting points:**
- Module 1 (Foundations) is recommended as a starting point
- Module 2 (Leadership) is recommended for leaders
- Other modules can be selected based on need

**Flexibility:** Schools can use modules in any order, combination, or frequency. They can revisit modules as needed.

### What Schools Should Never Be Forced to Do

**Never require:**
- Personal disclosure or sharing
- Emotional disclosure
- Trauma history sharing
- Therapeutic techniques
- Clinical interventions
- Completion of all modules
- Specific timelines or schedules

**Why:** Forcing these creates risk, harm, and dependency. Schools must maintain autonomy and choice.

## What Modules Are NOT

### Not Therapy

Modules do not provide therapy, therapeutic techniques, or therapeutic interventions. They provide educational content and practical guidance.

### Not Safeguarding Training

Modules do not replace safeguarding training. They complement safeguarding by supporting trauma-informed responses, but they do not provide safeguarding procedures or protocols.

### Not Behaviour Management Programmes

Modules do not provide behaviour management programmes, scripts, or techniques. They provide principles and processes that guide responses, not fixed programmes to follow.

### Not Clinical Training

Modules do not provide clinical training, assessment, or intervention skills. They provide understanding and practical guidance, not clinical expertise.

### Not Mandatory

Modules are not mandatory. Schools choose which modules to use based on their needs and capacity.

---

## How Modules Work

### Asynchronous Delivery

Modules are designed for asynchronous completion. Staff can complete them at their own pace, in their own time, without requiring group sessions or live training.

### Self-Contained

Each module contains everything needed to complete it. No additional resources, training, or support are required (though support may be available).

### Practical Focus

Modules focus on practical application, not just theory. They provide guidance that can be applied immediately, not just concepts to understand.

### Reflection-Based

Modules include reflection prompts that support learning and application. Reflection is optional and non-evaluative.

---

## Module Quality Standards

All modules must:
- Be completable in 30–60 minutes
- Require no personal disclosure
- Stand alone independently
- Be safe under inspection
- Focus on adult actions
- Avoid therapeutic techniques
- Respect professional boundaries
- Support learning, not compliance

## Version

This is Version 1. The module set may evolve based on learning and feedback, but any changes will be documented and explained.
