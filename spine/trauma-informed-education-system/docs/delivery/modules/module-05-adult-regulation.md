## Common Misuse Patterns + Redirection

### Misuse: Individual Responsibility Only

**Pattern:** Expecting adults to regulate without systemic support.

**Redirection:** Systems must support adult regulation. Leaders create conditions. Individuals use strategies within supportive systems.

---

### Misuse: Skill Focus Only

**Pattern:** Teaching regulation techniques without reducing stress load.

**Redirection:** Reduce stress load AND teach techniques. Support capacity, not just skills. Create systems that reduce load.

---

### Misuse: Perfectionism

**Pattern:** Expecting adults to be perfectly regulated all the time.

**Redirection:** Regulation varies day to day. Stress affects regulation. Support regulation, don't expect perfection.

---

### Misuse: Blame

**Pattern:** Blaming adults for dysregulation instead of supporting regulation.

**Redirection:** Support regulation. Recognise that stress affects regulation. Create systems that support capacity.
