## Common Misuse Patterns + Redirection

### Misuse: Asking Parents for Therapy

**Pattern:** Asking parents to provide therapeutic interventions or clinical support.

**Redirection:** Schools support children in school contexts. Parents support children in home contexts. Neither replaces the other. Refer to appropriate professionals for therapy.

---

### Misuse: Blaming Parents

**Pattern:** Blaming parents for children's challenges or behaviour.

**Redirection:** Work in partnership. Recognise that both home and school matter. Focus on support, not blame.

---

### Misuse: Excessive Responsibility

**Pattern:** Asking parents to take responsibility for things that are the school's responsibility.

**Redirection:** Clarify roles and responsibilities. Schools are responsible for school contexts. Parents are responsible for home contexts. Work together, don't shift responsibility.

---

### Misuse: Compliance Pressure

**Pattern:** Pressuring parents to comply with approaches that don't work for their family.

**Redirection:** Work in partnership. Adapt approaches where possible. Respect family context and choices.

## Safeguarding & Boundary Note

This module supports work with parents. It does NOT replace safeguarding training or procedures. If you have safeguarding concerns, follow your school's safeguarding procedures immediately. Working with parents supports safeguarding by maintaining appropriate relationships and communication, but it does NOT replace safeguarding protocols or professional responsibilities. Always follow safeguarding procedures first.
