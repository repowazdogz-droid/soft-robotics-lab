# TSRFC Prototype — Pre-meeting context

This is a prototype for comparing surgical innovation concepts against current
practice using translational friction surfaces (technical, workflow, economic,
adoption) and evidence strength, rather than clinical outcomes.

The goal is to make implicit adoption trade-offs explicit and support structured
discussion. Values are illustrative and scenario-specific.

This framework supports critique rather than presenting conclusions. Patient
Value is acknowledged qualitatively in this version; outcomes and safety are not
modeled quantitatively.

This is not a clinical decision support tool and should not be interpreted as
validated data or scoring.
