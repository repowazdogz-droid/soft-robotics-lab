# Omega — Mac Setup (Authoring Spine)

This Mac is the primary **authoring environment** for the Omega spine.
It is optimized for clarity, safety, and reasoning — not bulk compute.

## Purpose
- Write and evolve spine contracts
- Author decision logic
- Review simulations, data, and learning outputs
- Control routing and orchestration
- Maintain alignment and auditability

## What this Mac is NOT used for
- Large-scale data generation
- Heavy model training
- GPU-bound workloads
- Long-running batch jobs

Those run on PC or local servers.

## Required Tools
- Cursor (primary interface)
- Git + GitHub
- Python 3.11+
- Optional: Docker (later)

## Operating Principles
- One repo (`omega`)
- Contracts are append-only
- Changes are deliberate and reviewable
- No silent automation
