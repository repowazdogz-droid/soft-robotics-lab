## 1. Release Principle

Release must adhere to these principles:

### Exposure Is Intentional
- All releases are deliberate and planned
- No accidental or unintended exposure
- Release decisions are explicit and documented
- Intentionality is mandatory

### Scope Precedes Scale
- Scope is defined before scale is considered
- Limited scope is preferred over broad scale
- Scale expansion requires scope validation
- Scope takes precedence over reach

### Trust Beats Reach
- Trusted, limited audiences are preferred
- Reach is not prioritized over trust
- Trust relationships are valued over scale
- Trust is a release requirement

### Reversibility Is Mandatory
- All releases must be reversible
- Revocation mechanisms must exist
- Rollback procedures must be documented
- Irreversible releases are prohibited

## 6. Tiered Disclosure

Prefer:

### Minimal Viable Exposure
- Expose only what is necessary
- Minimal exposure is preferred
- Avoid over-exposure
- Minimal viable exposure is the default

### Partial Datasets
- Share partial datasets when possible
