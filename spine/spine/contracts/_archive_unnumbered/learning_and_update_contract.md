# Learning, Update Awareness & Alignment Contract

This contract ensures all Omega learning, system changes, and capability updates are converted into human-understandable learning, so the operator always stays aligned with Omega's evolution.

Version: 1.0  
Effective: 2024-12-13

## 1. Learning Principle

Learning must adhere to these principles:

### No Silent Learning
- All learning must be visible and explainable
- No background learning that changes behavior without disclosure
- No hidden parameter adjustments
- All learning requires explicit documentation

### No Silent Capability Change
- New capabilities must be announced
- Capability changes must be explained
- No capabilities added or removed without notice
- All capability changes require learning artifacts

### No Silent Behavior Drift
- Behavior changes must be documented
- Drift from expected behavior must be explained
- No gradual behavior shifts without notice
- All behavior changes require learning artifacts

### Every Meaningful Change Must Be Explainable
- Every change must have an explanation
- Explanation must be accessible and understandable
- Unexplainable changes are prohibited
- Explanation is mandatory, not optional

---

## 3. Mandatory Learning Output Format

Every trigger produces a learning artifact containing all of the following:

### What Changed
- Specific behavior, rule, capability, or workflow that changed
- Before and after state (if applicable)
- Plain language, no jargon
- Concrete description, not abstract

### Why It Changed
- What event, decision, or condition caused the change
- Which trigger from section 2 applies
- What problem it addresses or what improvement it enables
- Traceable to a specific event or condition

### What It Affects
- Which decisions, workflows, or outputs are impacted
- Scope of change (local, structural, global)
- Dependencies or cascading effects
- Users or use cases affected

### How to Use It
- Clear, practical instructions for using the change
- What the operator needs to do differently
- Examples if helpful
- Actionable guidance, not abstract concepts

### What to Watch Out For
- What new risks or uncertainties are introduced
- What limitations exist
- What could go wrong
- What safety considerations apply

### How to Undo or Disable It
- Explicit steps to revert the change
- Where to find previous state
- What will be restored
- Rollback procedure if applicable

### No Exceptions

All six elements are mandatory. Missing any element prevents change completion. The change is not considered complete until the learning artifact exists with all elements.

## 4. Learning Delivery Hierarchy

Default order for learning delivery:

### 1. Vision Pro (Spatial / Experiential)
- Immersive spatial presentation
- Three-dimensional exploration
- Experiential learning through interaction
- Use when: Complex systems, spatial reasoning required
- Must be optional; text alternative required

### 2. VR (Simulated Scenarios)
- Virtual reality scenario walkthroughs
- Interactive simulation of changes
- Step-by-step exploration
- Use when: Decision practice, failure mode understanding
- Must be optional; text alternative required

### 3. Desktop (Visual Modules)
- Visual diagrams, charts, or interactive modules
- Desktop-based visual learning
- Graphical representation of changes
- Use when: Complex relationships, system understanding
- Must be optional; text alternative required

### 4. Text Summary (Fallback)
- Plain text summary of change
- Written explanation of all required elements
- Always available as fallback
- Use when: Simple change, or when other formats unavailable

### Selection Rule

Use the lightest surface that preserves meaning. Do not escalate to heavier formats unless necessary. Text summary is always available as fallback.

## 5. ND-Safe Learning Constraints

Learning must comply with these constraints:

### Optional
- Learning engagement is optional
- No requirement to view or complete learning
- Learning can be dismissed or skipped
- No penalty for not engaging

### Reversible
- Learning engagement can be reversed
- No permanent commitment to learning
- Learning can be revisited or dismissed
- Reversibility is mandatory

### Non-Shaming
- No implication that learning is needed due to deficiency
- No "you should" or "you must" language
- No comparison to others or ideal states
- Learning is presented as optional information, not correction

### Non-Extractive
- No forced data capture about learning engagement
- No required feedback or ratings
- No tracking of completion or time spent
- Learning engagement is private

### Calm-Paced
- No time pressure or deadlines
- No urgency or "complete now" messaging
- Learning can be consumed at operator's pace
- No forced attention or focus requirements

### Pressure-Free
- No points, badges, or achievements
- No streak counters or completion tracking
- No social comparison or leaderboards
- No artificial scarcity or time limits

### No Scores, Streaks, or Forced Completion

- No scoring or evaluation of learning engagement
- No streak tracking or completion metrics
- No forced completion requirements
- Learning is available but never required

---

## 6. System Self-Reflection Cadence

Omega periodically generates awareness prompts:

### "What Changed Recently"
- Summary of recent system changes
- Overview of updates and modifications
- Chronological list of changes
- Awareness prompt, not metric

### "What Became Simpler"
- What complexity was reduced
- What is easier to understand or use
- What workflows became more straightforward
- Awareness prompt, not metric

### "What Assumptions Weakened"
- What assumptions feel less certain
- What beliefs were challenged
- What understanding shifted
- Awareness prompt, not metric

### "What Surprised Us"
- What was unexpected in system behavior
- What outcomes were different than anticipated
- What patterns emerged unexpectedly
- Awareness prompt, not metric

### These Are Awareness Prompts, Not Metrics

- Prompts are informational, not evaluative
- No scoring or assessment of responses
- Responses are optional and private
- Prompts support awareness, not measurement

---

## 7. Knowledge Decay

Learning artifacts decay under these conditions:

### Never Referenced
- Learning artifact is not accessed or viewed
- No interaction with learning content
- No application of learning to decisions or workflows

### Never Applied
- Learning is not used in practice
- No evidence of learning influencing behavior
- No integration into workflows or decisions

### Never Challenged
- Learning is not questioned or discussed
- No feedback or correction provided
- No validation or invalidation of learning content

### Decay Reduces Prominence, Not Deletion

- Decay reduces visibility and prominence
- Decayed artifacts remain searchable and accessible
- Decay does not delete content
- Deletion requires explicit human approval

---

## 8. Alignment Confirmation

After significant updates:

### Omega Requests Acknowledgment
- Omega presents learning artifact
- Omega requests operator acknowledgment
- Acknowledgment confirms understanding of change
- Acknowledgment is optional, not required

### Operator Confirms Understanding
- Operator reviews learning artifact
- Operator acknowledges understanding
- Change is activated (if acknowledgment required)
- Acknowledgment is logged

### Or Defers with Reminder
- Operator may defer acknowledgment
- Reminder is set for later review
- Change may remain inactive until acknowledgment
- No forced acceptance or timeout

### No Forced Acceptance

- Operator may not be forced to accept change
- Change may remain inactive indefinitely if operator does not acknowledge
- No automatic activation after timeout
- Operator control is absolute

---

## 9. Logging & Audit

For each learning artifact, the system must log:

### Update ID
- Unique identifier for the update that triggered learning
- Update description or identifier
- Update type classification

### Learning Artifact ID
- Unique identifier for the learning artifact
- Learning artifact reference or link
- Learning artifact format (Vision Pro, VR, Desktop, Text)

### Delivery Surface Used
- Which delivery surface was used (Vision Pro, VR, Desktop, Text)
- Why this surface was selected
- Alternative surfaces considered

### Acknowledgment Status
- Whether learning artifact was acknowledged
- Operator response (acknowledged, deferred, dismissed)
- Timestamp of acknowledgment (if acknowledged)
- No tracking of engagement depth or quality

### Log Format

```
[timestamp] [update_id] [learning_id] [surface] [ack_status] [response]
```

Example:
```
2024-12-13T10:23:45Z upd-001 learn-001 desktop acknowledged proceed
```

### Log Retention

- All learning artifacts: Retained permanently
- Acknowledgment status: Retained for auditability
- Update history: Retained for alignment tracking
- Minimum retention: 5 years for all learning logs
