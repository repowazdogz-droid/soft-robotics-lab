# Learning Delivery Surfaces Contract

This contract controls where and how learning is delivered so that form never overwhelms judgment.

### 5. Static Documents
- Static documents are lowest preference
- Static documents provide basic information
- Static documents are fallback only

### Higher-Ranked Surfaces Are Used Only When They Add Meaning

- Higher-ranked surfaces require meaning justification

## 2. Surface Selection Rule

Omega must choose a surface based on:

### Cognitive Benefit

### Physical Effort Required
- Surface selection considers physical effort

- Sitting or standing support is mandatory
- Forced positions are prohibited

### Avoid Forced Attention
- Vision Pro learning avoids forced attention

- Forced attention is prohibited

### Allow Instant Exit
- Vision Pro learning allows instant exit
- Exit is immediate and without penalty
- Instant exit is mandatory
- Delayed or penalized exit is prohibited

### No Continuous Stimulation

- Vision Pro learning avoids continuous stimulation
- Stimulation is bounded and restful
- Continuous stimulation is prohibited
- Continuous stimulation is a violation

---

## 4. VR Constraints

VR learning must:

### Avoid Locomotion
- VR learning avoids locomotion
- No walking or movement requirements
- Avoiding locomotion is mandatory
- Requiring locomotion is prohibited

### Avoid Time Pressure
- VR learning avoids time pressure
- No deadlines or urgency
- Avoiding time pressure is mandatory
- Time pressure is prohibited

### Support Short Sessions
- VR learning supports short sessions
- Sessions are brief and manageable
- Short session support is mandatory
- Long session requirements are prohibited

### Never Require Physical Exertion

- VR learning never requires physical exertion
- No physical effort or strain
- Physical exertion is prohibited
- Requiring physical exertion is a violation

---

## 5. Desktop and Mobile Defaults

If spatial benefit is marginal:

### Use Desktop First
- Desktop is used first when spatial benefit is marginal
- Desktop is preferred over mobile
- Desktop-first is mandatory
- Using mobile when desktop available is prohibited

### Use Mobile Only for Short, Lightweight Artefacts
- Mobile is used only for short, lightweight artefacts
- Mobile is not used for long or complex learning
- Mobile use is limited to short/lightweight
- Using mobile for long/complex learning is prohibited

---

## 6. Consistency Across Surfaces

The same learning content must:

### Preserve Meaning Across Surfaces
- Learning meaning is preserved across surfaces
- Meaning does not change with surface
- Meaning preservation is mandatory
- Changing meaning across surfaces is prohibited

### Not Introduce New Conclusions
- Learning does not introduce new conclusions on different surfaces
- Conclusions remain consistent
- Avoiding new conclusions is mandatory
- Introducing new conclusions is prohibited

### Not Change Intent
- Learning intent does not change across surfaces
- Intent remains consistent
- Intent consistency is mandatory
- Changing intent across surfaces is prohibited

### Only Representation May Change

- Only representation may change across surfaces
- Representation adapts to surface capabilities
- Representation changes are allowed
- Changing meaning, conclusions, or intent is prohibited

---

## 7. Accessibility

All surfaces must:

### Support Pause
- All surfaces support pausing
- Pause is available at any time
- Pause support is mandatory
- Missing pause support is a violation

### Support Replay
- All surfaces support replay
- Replay allows reviewing content
- Replay support is mandatory
- Missing replay support is a violation

### Support Exit Without Penalty

- All surfaces support exit without penalty
- Exit is immediate and without consequences
- Exit without penalty is mandatory
- Penalizing exit is prohibited

---

## 8. Feedback Awareness

Omega must note:

### Which Surfaces Were Chosen
- Omega tracks which surfaces were chosen
- Surface choice tracking is mandatory
- Choice data informs future selection
- Missing choice tracking is a violation

### Which Were Abandoned
- Omega tracks which surfaces were abandoned
- Abandonment tracking is mandatory
- Abandonment data informs future selection
- Missing abandonment tracking is a violation

### Which Improved Understanding

- Omega tracks which surfaces improved understanding
- Understanding improvement tracking is mandatory
- Improvement data informs future selection
- Missing improvement tracking is a violation

---

## 9. Human Override

Human may:

### Force a Surface
- Human can force use of a specific surface
- Surface forcing overrides default selection
- Surface forcing authority is absolute
- Surface forcing cannot be overridden

### Block a Surface
- Human can block use of a specific surface
- Surface blocking prevents selection
