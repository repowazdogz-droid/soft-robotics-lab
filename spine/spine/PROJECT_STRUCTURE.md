# PROJECT STRUCTURE — HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP SPATIAL INTELLIGENCE

## GOAL (ONE SENTENCE)

Design a human-led, non-autonomous spatial intelligence system that helps people explore, reason about, and communicate complex spatial systems (robotics, simulation, XR, digital twins) without taking control, making decisions, or issuing operational commands.

## NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS

- Human judgment remains sovereign at all times
- No autonomy, no agents, no self-initiated actions
- Descriptive, exploratory, and reasoning support only
- No real-world actuation or operational control
- Safe to demo publicly to academics, engineers, clinicians

## SYSTEM BOUNDARIES (WHAT THIS IS)

- A cognitive and spatial reasoning aid
- A visualization and exploration layer
- A translation bridge between disciplines
- A teaching, demo, and thinking tool

## SYSTEM BOUNDARIES (WHAT THIS IS NOT)

- Not a controller
- Not a planner
- Not a simulator that executes actions
- Not an optimizer
- Not a decision-maker

## CORE CAPABILITIES (HIGH LEVEL)

1. Spatial visualization of systems and scenarios
2. Human-guided exploration of variants and configurations
3. Reasoning about constraints, uncertainty, and trade-offs
4. Explanation and simplification for mixed audiences
5. Reflection and learning from exploration sessions

## OMEGA MODE MAPPING

- **OMEGA-V**: Spatial exploration, visuals, variants, creative layouts
- **OMEGA v37**: Reasoning, constraints, uncertainty, explanation
- **OMEGA-B**: Building demos, scenes, pipelines (only when explicitly invoked)
- **OMEGA-R**: Learning from demos, talks, experiments
- **OMEGA-G**: Safety, boundary checks, demo risk control

## FIRST DEMO PRINCIPLE

If it cannot be explained calmly on a whiteboard, it is out of scope for the first version.

## SUCCESS CRITERIA (V1)

- Academics understand it without defensiveness
- Engineers see how it fits their work without fear of autonomy creep
- Clinicians are comfortable with safety and boundaries
- You feel in control, not overwhelmed
