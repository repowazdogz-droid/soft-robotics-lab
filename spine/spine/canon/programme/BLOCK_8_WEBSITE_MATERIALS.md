# BLOCK 8 — WEBSITE & PUBLIC MATERIALS
Shared Reality Programme

**Status:** Canonical  
**Purpose:** Provide a simple, credible public surface for buyers, partners, and communities  
**Constraint:** Must feel human, calm, and trustworthy — not "AI", not consultancy, not therapy  

---

## 1. WEBSITE GOAL

The website is not to:
- Sell aggressively
- Explain theory
- Impress technically
- Capture data

The website exists to:
- Make the programme legible
- Signal safety and seriousness
- Let the *right* people opt in
- Let the *wrong* people self-select out

---

## 2. SITE STRUCTURE (SINGLE-PAGE)

### Section 1 — Hero
**Headline**
> Helping people see the same situation clearly — before pressure turns into harm.

**Subline**
> A human-led programme for care, education, and community settings where decisions matter.

**Primary CTA**
- "Explore the programme"
- Secondary: "Talk to us"

Tone: calm, grounded, non-urgent

---

### Section 2 — The Problem (Plain Language)

**Copy**
> Most harm doesn't happen because people don't care.  
> It happens because people are acting from different versions of what's going on.

Bullets:
- Pressure compresses understanding
- ND voices are often misunderstood
- Decisions are made too quickly
- Escalations feel avoidable in hindsight

---

### Section 3 — What Shared Reality Is

Three cards:
1. **Shared Understanding**
   - Helping teams see the same situation from all sides
2. **ND-Aware Sense-Making**
   - Making space for different ways of processing and communicating
3. **Decision Support Under Pressure**
   - Pausing at the moments that matter most

Explicit "What it is not" toggle (expandable).

---

### Section 4 — How It Works (Simple Flow)

1. Create safety and shared language  
2. Make pressure visible  
3. Align understanding around a real situation  
4. Support safer decisions  
5. Capture learning without blame  

No diagrams that look technical.

---

### Section 5 — Who It's For

Tiles:
- Social enterprises & charities
- NHS-adjacent services
- Local authorities
- Schools & trusts
- ND advocacy organisations
- Cross-boundary partnerships

Subtext:
> If your work involves people, pressure, and responsibility — this is likely relevant.

---

### Section 6 — Why ND Communities Trust This

Key points:
- No labelling
- No behaviour scoring
- No forced disclosure
- Multiple communication modes
- Slower, safer conversations

Short lived-experience quote placeholder (anonymous).

### Section 7 — What Leaders & Commissioners Get

Bullets:

---

### Section 8 — Pilot Offer

**Headline**
> Start with a small, safe pilot.

Details:
- 4–6 weeks
- One cohort
- Human-facilitated

CTA:
- "Discuss a pilot"

---

### Section 9 — Ethics & Boundaries

Explicit statements:

- Not surveillance
- Not AI-led
- Not a diagnostic tool

This builds trust.

---

### Section 10 — Contact

Simple:

No forms longer than name + email + organisation.

---

## 3. VISUAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES

- Calm colours (no neon, no dark mode by default)

Accessibility:

---

## 4. SUPPORTING MATERIALS

---

## 5. WHAT THE SITE MUST NOT DO

If it feels clever, it's wrong.
