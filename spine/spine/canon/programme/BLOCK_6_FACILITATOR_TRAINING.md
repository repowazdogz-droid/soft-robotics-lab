# BLOCK 6 — FACILITATOR TRAINING & ACCREDITATION PATHWAY
Shared Reality Programme

**Status:** Canonical  
**Purpose:** Protect fidelity, safety, and scalability of the programme  
**Principle:** The quality of the work is inseparable from the quality of facilitation  

---

## 1. PURPOSE OF THIS BLOCK

The Shared Reality Programme does not scale through materials, tools, or automation.  
It scales through *people who can hold pressure without collapsing into fixing, blame, or avoidance*.

This block defines:
- Who can facilitate
- How facilitators are developed
- What competence actually means in this context
- How misuse or drift is prevented
- When facilitation rights are paused or removed

This is not certification theatre.
It is capability protection.

---

## 2. WHO CAN BE A FACILITATOR

Facilitators may come from:
- Social care
- Mental health
- Education
- Community organisations
- ND advocacy
- Lived-experience leadership
- Organisational development

**They do NOT need:**
- Clinical qualifications
- Coaching accreditation
- AI literacy
- Therapy training
- Management seniority

**They MUST demonstrate:**
- Capacity to hold silence
- Comfort with ambiguity
- Non-defensive response to challenge
- Respect for ND difference
- Ability to slow a room under pressure

---

## 3. WHO MUST NOT FACILITATE

The following profiles are *not* suitable without substantial unlearning:

- Performance managers seeking leverage
- Compliance or audit leads
- People rewarded for "driving outcomes"
- Anyone needing to be seen as the expert
- Anyone uncomfortable naming uncertainty
- Anyone who rushes to reassurance

If facilitation becomes a status role, the programme fails.

---

## 4. FACILITATOR ROLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

A Shared Reality facilitator:
- Holds structure, not answers
- Protects safety over speed
- Names pressure without naming blame
- Interrupts premature problem-solving
- Maintains focus on the situation, not the person
- Makes misalignment visible without forcing resolution

They are not:
- A mediator
- A therapist
- A fixer
- A judge
- A decision-maker

---

## 5. TRAINING PATHWAY (FOUR PHASES)

### Phase 1 — Orientation (Observe)
Duration: 1–2 sessions

- Observe live Shared Reality sessions
- No facilitation
- Focus on:
  - Language
  - Pace
  - Intervention timing
  - ND adaptations
- Reflective notes only (private)

Exit condition:
- Can articulate what the facilitator *did not do*

---

### Phase 2 — Assisted Facilitation (Support)
Duration: 2–3 sessions

- Co-facilitate with a lead
- Responsible for:
  - Timekeeping
  - Pressure noticing
  - ND accommodation support
- No authority to redirect group alone

Exit condition:
- Demonstrates ability to slow the room without escalating tension

---

### Phase 3 — Lead Facilitation (Provisional)
Duration: 2–4 sessions

- Leads sessions with shadow support
- Handles:
  - Orientation
  - Pressure Mapping
  - Shared Reality Session
- Shadow facilitator intervenes only for safety

Exit condition:
- Group safety maintained
- Misalignment surfaced without collapse into fixing
- ND participants report felt safety

---

### Phase 4 — Independent Facilitation
Status: Accredited Facilitator

- Can lead full pilot cycles
- May mentor Phase 1–2 facilitators
- Remains subject to periodic review

---

## 6. CORE FACILITATION COMPETENCIES

Facilitators must reliably demonstrate:

1. **Pressure Literacy**
   - Can notice rising strain before escalation
   - Names pressure early and neutrally

2. **Pace Control**
   - Slows the group when urgency appears
   - Resists pressure to "wrap up"

3. **ND Awareness**
   - Adjusts format without explanation or apology
   - Normalises difference without spotlighting

4. **Boundary Holding**
   - Stops sessions when safety degrades
   - Refuses inappropriate use of outputs

5. **Non-Substitution**
   - Does not replace participant judgment
   - Does not offer solutions disguised as questions

---

## 7. ND-SPECIFIC FACILITATION REQUIREMENTS

Facilitators must:
- Offer multiple modes of contribution by default
- Avoid interpreting affect as intent
- Allow silence without filling it
- Explicitly permission pauses or withdrawal
- Avoid eye-contact pressure or forced participation

Failure to uphold these invalidates facilitation status.

---

## 8. REVIEW & CONTINUING PRACTICE

Facilitation is reviewed through:
- Peer reflection (not scoring)
- Occasional shadowing
- Participant safety feedback
- Self-declared uncertainty moments

No numerical ratings.
No performance metrics.

---

## 9. PAUSE & REMOVAL CONDITIONS

Facilitation rights are paused if:
- Sessions are used for performance management
- Outputs are treated as evidence against individuals
- Speed overrides safety
- ND needs are minimised or ignored
- Facilitator becomes outcome-attached

Reinstatement requires:
- Reflection
- Re-observation
- Explicit recommitment to principles

---

## 10. WHY THIS MATTERS

The Shared Reality Programme works because:
- It creates space where none existed
- It slows systems that usually rush
- It makes harm less likely without assigning blame

Facilitators are the system.

If this block is weakened, the entire programme collapses.

---

## BLOCK 6 STATUS

- Training pathway defined
- Accreditation logic complete
- Safety and misuse prevention embedded
- Ready for live pilot use
