# RC Audit Demo Runbook (VisionOS)

## Goal
Demonstrate OmegaRC as a **safe reasoning lens**:
- bounded to user-provided text
- non-persuasive
- shareable

## 30-second flow
1. Switch to **RC Audit**
2. Choose a screenshot (optional)
3. Paste a claim/caption (manual)
4. Tap **Run RC Audit**
5. Show:
   - Evidence Present vs Evidence Absent
   - Uncertainty Boundary
6. Tap **Copy Audit Card** (paste into Notes)
7. (Optional) Improve the claim, run again, **Save as B**
8. Tap **Compare A→B** to show structural change without judgment

## What to say (verbatim)
"This is local-only and bounded to what I paste.  
It doesn't decide what's true.  
It shows what the claim needs to be responsibly supported."

## Stop condition
If someone asks:
- "Can it tell me if it's true?"
- "Can it read the slide automatically?"
- "Can it rewrite this to convince people?"

Answer:
"Not in this mode. This demo is intentionally bounded for safety."

## Safety checklist (before demo)
- Confirm RC Audit works without internet
- Confirm no OCR text extraction exists
- Confirm outputs contain no verdict language
- Confirm Compare says "structural diff, not judgment"
