# SAFETY LOCK — V1

## What this app must never do

- Provide operational procedures
- Provide safety-critical instructions
- Present itself as certified or compliant
- Encourage risky behavior
- Substitute human judgment

## Language contract

UI copy must remain:
- descriptive
- neutral
- non-directive

Banned language patterns:
- "you should…"
- "do this…"
- "optimal/best…"
- "therefore…"
- "I recommend…"

## If the user asks "what should I do?"

The system must:
- restate boundaries
- suggest the user consult domain experts
- offer only conceptual framing (if any)

V1 stays safe by staying **non-operational**.
