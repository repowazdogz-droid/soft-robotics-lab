# ROOM_NAME — V1 LOCK

## Non-negotiables
- Human-led. Non-autonomous. Visual reasoning only.
- Not a simulation. No prediction. No optimization. No recommendations.
- Nothing moves unless the user moves the camera.

## Allowed interactions (V1)
- Camera movement only
- Layer toggles
- Selection (Inspector shows neutral metadata)
- Reset view

## Disallowed (V1)
- Motion / trajectories / time evolution
- "Run" / "Execute" / control loops
- Any "best choice" / prescriptions / scoring

## Change policy
- V1 is frozen. Only bug fixes allowed without explicit version bump.
