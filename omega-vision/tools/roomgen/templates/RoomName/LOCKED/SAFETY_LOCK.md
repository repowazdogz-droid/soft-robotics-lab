# SAFETY LOCK — V1

## What this app must never do
- Provide operational procedures
- Provide safety-critical instructions
- Present itself as certified or compliant
- Encourage risky behavior
- Substitute human judgment

## Language contract
UI copy must remain:
- descriptive
- neutral
- non-directive

Banned language patterns:
- "you should…"
- "do this…"
- "optimal/best…"
- "therefore…"
- "I recommend…"

## If the user asks "what should I do?"
The system must:
- restate boundaries
- suggest the user consult domain experts
- offer only conceptual framing (if any)

V1 stays safe by staying **non-operational**.

---

## Trust Language

**Footer requirement:**
The footer must always display:
"Human-led. Non-autonomous. Visual reasoning only. Not a simulation."

**Language constraints:**
- Must avoid language implying prediction, decision, or advice
- Must treat boundaries as boundaries ("not a verdict", "not truth/falsity")
- Must use neutral, descriptive language only
- Must never claim certainty or inevitability

**Banned phrases:**
- "This causes..."
- "This will..."
- "You should..."
- "The best option is..."
- "This proves..."
