# CausalRoom Demo Runbook (VisionOS)

## One-Line Description
A static, conceptual causal reasoning surface that shows nodes, links, and boundaries — not predictions, not decisions, not advice.

## What to Say (3 bullets)
- "This shows causal structure and boundaries as visual aids for thinking."
- "It doesn't predict, simulate, or recommend — it just makes structure visible."
- "Disallowed links are boundary markers, not verdicts."

## What It Is NOT (3 bullets)
- **Not a simulator**: No time evolution, no dynamics, no "what if" scenarios
- **Not a decision engine**: No optimization, no "best" selection, no recommendations
- **Not a truth claim**: Links are illustrative, not asserted facts

## Demo Flow (60 seconds)

### 1) Show Nodes (10s)
- "Here are 6 conceptual nodes arranged in a ring."
- Toggle "Nodes" layer on/off
- Select a node → Inspector shows neutral metadata

### 2) Select a Link (15s)
- Toggle "Links" layer on
- Tap a link (white cylinder)
- Inspector shows: title, from/to, meaning, boundary
- Emphasize: "Illustrative influence, not a truth claim"

### 3) Select a Disallowed Link (15s)
- Toggle "Disallowed Links" layer on
- Tap a disallowed link (red dashed line)
- Inspector shows boundary explanation
- Emphasize: "This is a boundary marker, not a verdict"

### 4) Toggle Uncertainty (10s)
- Toggle "Uncertainty" layer on/off
- Show halos around N2 and N5
- Note: "These are visual indicators, not danger signals"

### 5) Reset View (10s)
- Press "Reset View"
- Camera/state resets
- Nothing moves except camera

## Pressure Questions & Safe Responses

**"Can it predict?"**
→ "No. It shows claims/boundaries, not forecasts."

**"Can it choose the best?"**
→ "No. It doesn't decide."

**"Can we run a simulation?"**
→ "Not in this room."

**"Can it tell me what to do?"**
→ "No. It's a reasoning surface, not an advisor."

**"Are the links true?"**
→ "Links are illustrative, not asserted truth. They show hypothesized influences, not proven causation."

## Stop Condition

**If audience tries to turn it into control/prediction:**
- Stop the demo
- Restate the contract: "This is a visual reasoning surface, not a simulator or decision engine."
- Redirect: "If you need simulation or optimization, that would be a different tool."

## Safety Checklist (Before Demo)
- Confirm footer displays: "Human-led. Non-autonomous. Visual reasoning only. Not a simulation."
- Confirm no motion except camera
- Confirm inspector language is neutral (no advice, no recommendations)
- Confirm disallowed links are described as boundaries, not verdicts
