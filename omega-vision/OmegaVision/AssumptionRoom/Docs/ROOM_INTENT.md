# AssumptionRoom — Intent

AssumptionRoom is a static spatial reasoning surface.

It makes assumptions visible as objects, and shows:
- assumptions
- conflicts between assumptions
- unsupported regions (missing assumptions)
- uncertainty regions

It does not:
- predict outcomes
- recommend actions
- run simulations
- claim correctness

Human-led. Non-autonomous. Visual reasoning only.
