# CORE LOCK — ConstraintRoom (V1)

This project is a **trust surface**.

It is **not** a simulator, controller, planner, or agent.

## Non-negotiables

- Human-led, non-autonomous
- No time evolution
- No physics
- No run/play actions
- No recommendations
- No optimization
- No "best" outputs
- No hidden goals

## Allowed interactions (V1)

- Walk/look (head pose)
- Layer toggles (UI)
- Tap-to-inspect (read-only metadata)
- Reset View (camera/state reset only)

## Disallowed interactions (V1)

- Grabbing/dragging objects
- Scaling/rotating objects
- Editing geometry
- Moving joints / "pose" control
- Trajectories
- Sliders that "solve"
- Simulate / predict / recommend

## Scope

V1 proves:
- calm spatial legibility
- explicit constraints/assumptions/uncertainty as separate layers
- selection → neutral inspector copy

Nothing beyond this.
