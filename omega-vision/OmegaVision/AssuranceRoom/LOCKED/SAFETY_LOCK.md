# SAFETY LOCK — V1

## What this app must never do
- Provide operational procedures
- Provide safety-critical instructions
- Present itself as certified or compliant
- Encourage risky behavior
- Substitute human judgment
- Claim guarantees or certifications
- Provide thresholds or decision rules

## Language contract
UI copy must remain:
- descriptive
- neutral
- non-directive
- non-procedural

Banned language patterns:
- "you should…"
- "do this…"
- "optimal/best…"
- "therefore…"
- "I recommend…"
- "guaranteed to…"
- "certified…"
- "compliant…"
- "follow these steps…"

## If the user asks "what should I do?"
The system must:
- restate boundaries
- suggest the user consult domain experts
- offer only conceptual framing (if any)

V1 stays safe by staying **non-operational**.

## Trust Language

**Footer requirement:**
The footer must always display:
"Human-led. Non-autonomous. Visual reasoning only. Not a simulation."

This exact text must appear in TrustFooter and remain consistent across all presets.

**Room-specific language:**
This room shows guarantees under degradation. It does not select an answer. It does not provide procedures. It does not certify.

**Language constraints:**
- Must avoid language implying prediction, decision, or advice
- Must treat outcomes as bounded classes, not procedures
- Must use neutral, descriptive language only
- Must never claim certainty, certification, or compliance
- Must never provide thresholds or decision rules

**Banned phrases:**
- "This guarantees..."
- "This certifies..."
- "This is compliant..."
- "You should choose..."
- "The best outcome is..."
- "Follow these steps..."
- "If X then Y..."
