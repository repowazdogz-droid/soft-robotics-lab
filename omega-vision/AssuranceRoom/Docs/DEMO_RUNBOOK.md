# AssuranceRoom — Demo Runbook (V1)

15-second intro (say this verbatim):
"This is a visual assurance ladder. It shows inputs, authority, outcomes, and overrides — but it does not provide procedures, certify, or simulate. Nothing moves unless we move the camera."

45-second flow:
1) Toggle Inputs: "These are degraded inputs or confidence levels (not prescriptions)."
2) Toggle Authority: "These are remaining control authority bands (not guarantees)."
3) Show Outcomes: "These are bounded outcome classes (not procedures)."
4) Show Overrides: "These are hard constraints that override capability (not advice)."
5) Show Trace: "This is a traceability surface (not an audit trail)."

If asked "Which outcome should we choose?"
Say:
"It doesn't choose. It helps you see what can be guaranteed under degradation so humans can decide."

If asked "What are the procedures?"
Say:
"It doesn't provide procedures. It shows bounded outcome classes, not step-by-step instructions."

Stop conditions:
- If someone asks for procedures/instructions: restate boundary and stop.
- If someone expects certification/compliance: restate "not certification" and stop.
- If someone expects motion/simulation: restate "not a simulator" and stop.
